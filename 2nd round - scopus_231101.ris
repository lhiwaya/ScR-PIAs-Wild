AB  - With the increasing number of smart devices and connections in Internet of Things (IoT) comes risks—specifically involving consumer data protection. In this respect, this exploratory research examines the current issues of IoT and personal data protection in Malaysia that includes: regulatory frameworks and data governance; issues and gaps; and key challenges in implementation. Results from this mixed-methods research indicates that a majority of consumers expressed concern about personal data risks due to increased usage of IoT devices. Moreover, there is a crucial need to increase regulation and accountability in the industry. In this regard, collaboration and partnerships between the main stakeholders are essential in tackling emerging issues of IoT and personal data protection. In order to strengthen IoT data governance, the fundamentals should be: strengthening consumer education and smart partnership between government-industry-civil society; providing motivation for active participation of NGOs and civil society; and obtaining industry buy-in. This paper also proposes a structure for the governance of evolving data-related technology, particularly in the case of data breaches or cyber incidents. It adds to the wider discussion of the current scenario, and proposes a model of collective responsibility in IoT data governance that is underpinned by the three principles of fair information practices, privacy impact assessment and privacy accountability. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Data protection Impact Assessments (DPIA) are used to assess how well a series of design choices safeguard the privacy concerns of data subjects, but they don't address how to analyse privacy conflicts. The challenge with current work on privacy conflict is the necessity to understand the perceived levels of sensitivity to facilitate negotiations. It is unclear how this can be achieved in DPIA procedure. In this work we introduce our model checking tool along with our method to address privacy conflict. We present our evaluation plan before concluding with our research roadmap.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - The Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is a process or methodology that should assist an organization in ensuring the reasonable and trustworthy use of personal data throughout the process. In the healthcare sector, medical information is typically extremely sensitive personal data that must be protected by ensuring a high level of privacy. In Thailand, The Thai government has recently enacted a new Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA), which mandates that organizations protect personal data by law. Furthermore, if the healthcare industry collects, stores, or processes patients' data from the European Union (EU), the data processors are obligated to conduct a DPIA in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The DPIA should be implemented as soon as the new processing of personal data is designed, and it is a continuous improvement process. However, the DPIA process is still relatively new in Thailand's healthcare sector. Therefore, this study proposes a process model for conducting DPIA suitable for the Thai healthcare industry. The proposed process model was adapted from leading DPIA guidelines in EU countries and Thailand's PDPA. The findings of this study should assist data controllers and project managers in conducting an adequate DPIA, thereby boosting public trust in their organization's information systems and ensuring compliance with PDPA and GDPR. © 2023 ICIC International.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to investigate the development of adolescents’ advertising literacy and privacy protection strategies in the context of targeted advertisements on social networking sites (SNSs). Design/methodology/approach: A survey was conducted among 374 adolescents between 12 and 17 years of age, and 469 young adults (18–25 years) served as a comparative benchmark. Findings: Results indicate that advertising literacy increases progressively throughout adolescence, and reaches adult-like levels only by the age of 16. In addition, adolescents have an inadequate awareness of commercial data collection practices. This awareness slowly increases as a function of their age until it reaches an adult level around the age of 20. Finally, findings reveal that adolescents take little action to cope with targeted advertisements by means of privacy protection strategies. Practical implications: This paper devotes much attention to the formulation of specific recommendations for EU policymakers and regulatory bodies. In addition, it also holds implications for advertisers (e.g. the need for more in-depth data protection impact assessments), social media providers (e.g. adolescent-friendly privacy policy) and social caretakers (e.g. achieving advertising literacy and privacy education). Originality/value: This paper fulfills the need to investigate adolescents’ advertising literacy and privacy-protective behaviors on SNSs, and, in turn, directly translates these insights into recommendations that can underpin the rationale of regulatory or policy decisions on a European level. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Setting: In Alberta, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) COVID-19 tests were an important step in detecting and isolating contagious individuals throughout the pandemic. Initially, a staff member provided results to all PCR COVID-19 test clients by phone. As the number of tests increased, new approaches were essential for timely result notification. Intervention: An innovative automated IT system was introduced during the pandemic to reduce workloads and support timely result notification. At the time of the COVID-19 test booking and again following swabbing, clients had an option to consent to receive their test results via an automated text or voice message. Prior to implementation, a privacy impact assessment was approved, a pilot was undertaken, and changes to lab information systems were made. Outcomes: Health administration data were used in a cost analysis to compare the unique costs associated with the novel automated IT practice (e.g., administration, integration, messages, staffing costs) and a hypothetical staff caller practice (e.g., administration, staffing costs) for negative test results. The costs of sharing 2,161,605 negative test results in 2021 were assessed. The automated IT practice demonstrated a cost savings of $6,272,495 over the staff caller practice. A follow-up analysis determined the cost savings threshold of 46,463 negative tests to break even. Implications: Using an automated IT practice for consenting clients can be a cost-effective approach to reach clients in a timely manner during a pandemic or other instances warranting direct notification. This approach is being explored for test result notification of other communicable diseases in other contexts. © 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive license to The Canadian Public Health Association.

AB  - Purpose: The paper posits that a solution for businesses to use privacy-friendly data repositories for its customers’ data is to change from the traditional centralized repository to a trusted, decentralized data repository. Blockchain is a technology that provides such a data repository. However, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) assumed a centralized data repository, and it is commonly argued that blockchain technology is not usable. This paper aims to posit a framework for adopting a blockchain that follows the GDPR. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses the Levy and Ellis’ narrative review of literature methodology, which is based on constructivist theory posited by Lincoln and Guba. Using five information systems and computer science databases, the researchers searched for studies using the keywords GDPR and blockchain, using a forward and backward search technique. The search identified a corpus of 416 candidate studies, from which the researchers applied pre-established criteria to select 39 studies. The researchers mined this corpus for concepts, which they clustered into themes. Using the accepted computer science practice of privacy by design, the researchers combined the clustered themes into the paper’s posited framework. Findings: The paper posits a framework that provides architectural tactics for designing a blockchain that follows GDPR to enhance privacy. The framework explicitly addresses the challenges of GDPR compliance using the unimagined decentralized storage of personal data. The framework addresses the blockchain–GDPR tension by establishing trust between a business and its customers vis-à-vis storing customers’ data. The trust is established through blockchain’s capability of providing the customer with private keys and control over their data, e.g. processing and access. Research limitations/implications: The paper provides a framework that demonstrates that blockchain technology can be designed for use in GDPR compliant solutions. In using the framework, a blockchain-based solution provides the ability to audit and monitor privacy measures, demonstrates a legal justification for processing activities, incorporates a data privacy policy, provides a map for data processing and ensures security and privacy awareness among all actors. The research is limited to a focus on blockchain–GDPR compliance; however, future research is needed to investigate the use of the framework in specific domains. Practical implications: The paper posits a framework that identifies the strategies and tactics necessary for GDPR compliance. Practitioners need to compliment the framework with rigorous privacy risk management, i.e. conducting a privacy risk analysis, identifying strategies and tactics to address such risks and preparing a privacy impact assessment that enhances accountability and transparency of a blockchain. Originality/value: With the increasingly strategic use of data by businesses and the contravening growth of data privacy regulation, alternative technologies could provide businesses with a means to nurture trust with its customers regarding collected data. However, it is commonly assumed that the decentralized approach of blockchain technology cannot be applied to this business need. This paper posits a framework that enables a blockchain to be designed that follows the GDPR; thereby, providing an alternative for businesses to collect customers’ data while ensuring the customers’ trust. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - To assure certain critical quality properties (e.g., safety, security, or privacy), supervisory authorities and industrial associations provide reference frameworks such as standards or guidelines that in some cases are enforced (e.g., regulations). Given the pace at which both technical advancements and risks appear, there is an increase in the number of reference frameworks. As several frameworks might apply for same systems, certain overlaps appear (e.g., regulations for different countries where the system will operate, or generic standards in conjunction with more concrete standards for a given industrial sector or system type). We propose the use of modelling for alleviating the complexity of these reference frameworks ecosystems, and we provide a tool-supported method to create them for the benefit of different stakeholders. The case study is based on privacy data protection, and more concretely on privacy impact assessment processes. The European GDPR regulates the movement and processing of personal data, and, contrary to available software engineering privacy guidelines, articles in legal texts are usually difficult to translate to the underlying processes, artefacts and roles that they refer to. To facilitate the mutual comprehension of legal experts and engineers, in this work we investigate how mappings can be created between these two domains of expertise. Notably, we rely on modelling as a central point. We modelled the legal requirements of the GDPR on data protection impact assessments, and then, we selected the ISO/IEC 29134, a mainstream engineering guideline for privacy impact assessment, and, taking a concrete sector as example, the EU Smart Grid Data Protection Impact Assessment template. The OpenCert tool was used for providing technical support to both the modelling and the creation of the mapping models in a systematic way. We provide a qualitative evaluation from legal experts and privacy engineering practitioners to report on the benefits and limitations of this approach. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - This Chapter analyses Article 35(9) GDPR, which requires controllers conducting Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) to seek the views of data subjects or their representatives on the intended processing 'where appropriate'. It discusses the benefits of data subjects' involvement in DPIAs, and how such involvement can be realised in practice. Legal perspectives are complemented by insights from Media & Communication Studies to consider arguments and models that could find ground in data protection regulation. The analysis shows that involving data subjects in DPIAs can have benefits for some kinds of empowerment. It can enable checks and balances vis-à-vis controllers' decisions and increase democratic legitimacy, improve the quality of DPIAs, and complement classic data protection control tools, such as consent and data subjects' rights. To realise this potential significant practical challenges need to be overcome. These include the limited expertise of assessors in participation methods, the limited literacy of non-expert citizens and/or their representatives in data protection issues, and the difficulty of creating inclusive participation processes that ensure good representativeness.

AB  - Presently, personal data protection and supplementary methods delivering the required level of confidentiality may not fulfil the existing European Union legal standards. Moreover, it still has numerous research gaps. Therefore, the most crucial objective demanded by multiple stakeholders is securing the correct application of privacy-enhancing technology (PET) methods concerning General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance. However, no review and analysis of the overlap exist between the PET and compliance domains focusing on security goals and the anonymization level. Consequently, this study focuses on the implications of security goals and Data Privacy Impact Assessment (DPIA) introduced in GDPR to enhance personal data security from the respondent's group standpoint, namely data protection officers, software developers, privacy legal practitioners and privacy researchers. Additionally, the consequence of different levels of anonymization, security goals, and PET method (Differential Privacy) concerning appropriate compliance will be studied. More importantly, our research method relies on a literature review and a detailed survey with a specific group of respondents. Therefore, this review provides a snapshot of the current situation between the needs of a particular group of respondents and security goals, with an additional focus on different anonymization levels and compliance requirements. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - How to protect people from algorithmic harms? A promising solution, although in its infancy, is algorithmic impact assessment (AIA). AIAs are iterative processes used to investigate the possible short and long terms societal impacts of AI systems before their use, but with ongoing monitoring and periodic revisiting even after their implementation. When conducted in a participatory and transparent fashion, they could create bridges across the legal, social and computer science domains, promoting the accountability of the entity performing them as well as public scrutiny. They could enable to re-attach the societal and regulatory context to the mathematical definition of fairness, thus expanding the formalistic approach thereto. Whilst the regulatory framework in the European Union currently lacks the obligation to perform such AIA, some other provisions are expected to play a role in AI development, leading the way towards more widespread adoption of AIA. These include the Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the risk assessment process under the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Conformity Assessment (CA) foreseen under the AI Regulation proposal. In this paper, after briefly introducing the plurality of definitions of fairness in the legal, social and computer science domains, and explaining to which extent the current and upcoming legal framework mandates the adoption of fairness metrics, we will illustrate how AIA could create bridges between all these disciplines, allowing us to build fairer AI solutions. We will then recognise the role of DPIA, DSA risk assessment and CA by discussing the contributions they can offer towards AIA but also identify the aspects lacking therein. We will then identify how these assessment provisions could aid the overall technical discussion of introducing and assessing fairness in AI-based models and processes. © 2023 ACM.

AB  - The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) harmonizes personal data protection laws across the European Union, affecting all sectors including the healthcare industry. For processing operations that pose a high risk for data subjects, a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is mandatory from May 2018. Taking into account the criticality of the process and the importance of its results, for the protection of the patients’ health data, as well as the complexity involved and the lack of past experience in applying such methodologies in healthcare environments, this paper presents the main steps of a DPIA study and provides guidelines on how to carry them out effectively. To this respect, the Privacy Impact Assessment, Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés (PIA-CNIL) methodology has been employed, which is also compliant with the privacy impact assessment tasks described in ISO/IEC 29134:2017. The work presented in this paper focuses on the first two steps of the DPIA methodology and more specifically on the identification of the Purposes of Processing and of the data categories involved in each of them, as well as on the evaluation of the organization’s GDPR compliance level and of the gaps (Gap Analysis) that must be filled-in. The main contribution of this work is the identification of the main organizational and legal requirements that must be fulfilled by the health care organization. This research sets the legal grounds for data processing, according to the GDPR and is highly relevant to any processing of personal data, as it helps to structure the process, as well as be aware of data protection issues and the relevant legislation. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The development of automated decision-making technologies creates the threat of de-iuridification: replacement of the legal acts' provisions with automated, technological solutions. The article examines how selected provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation concerning, among other things, data protection impact assessments, the right to not be subject to automated decision-making, information obligations and the right to access are applied in the Polish national legal order. We focus on the institutional and procedural solutions regarding the involvement of expert bodies and other stakeholders in the process of specification of the norms included in the gdpr and their enforcement. We argue that the example of Poland shows that the solutions adopted in the gdpr do not shift the balance concerning regulatory power in regard to automated decision-making to other stakeholders and as such do not favor of a more participative approach to the regulatory processes.  © KONINKLIJKE BRILL NV, LEIDEN, 2021.

AB  - Blockchain (BC) has recently paved the way for developing Decentralized Identity Management (IdM) systems for different information systems. Researchers widely use it to develop decentralized IdM systems for the Health Internet of Things (HIoT). HIoT is considered a vulnerable system that produces and processes sensitive data. BC-based IdM systems have the potential to be more secure and privacy-aware than centralized IdM systems. However, many studies have shown potential security risks to using BC. A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) conducted by the authors on BC-based IdM systems in HIoT systems showed a lack of comprehensive security and risk management frameworks for BC-based IdM systems in HIoT. Conducting a further SLR focusing on risk management and supplemented by Grey Literature (GL), in this paper, a security taxonomy, security framework, and cybersecurity risk management framework for the HIoT BC-IdM systems are identified and proposed. The cybersecurity risk management framework will significantly assist developers, researchers, and organizations in developing a secure BC-based IdM to ensure HIoT users’ data privacy and security. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The data protection impact assessment is used to verify the necessity, proportionality and risks of data processing. Our work is based on the data processed by the technical support of a Wireless Service Provider. The team of WISP tech support uses a machine learning system to predict failures. The goal of our the experiments was to evaluate the DPIA with personal data and without personal data. In fact, in a first scenario, the experiments were conducted using a machine learning application powered by non-anonymous personal data. Instead in the second scenario, the data was anonymized before feeding the machine learning system. In this article we evaluate how much the Data Protection Impact Assessment changes when moving from a scenario with raw data to a scenario with anonymized data. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - A Big Data Analytics (BDA) environment is a complex ecosystem that includes users, powerful infrastructure, services and applications that store, retrieve and process large amounts of data from widely dispersed sources. While BDA has improved efficiency and created business value, leading to growing interest from businesses and organisations in investing in such technologies, there are some growing concerns about the secure and lawful processing of personal data under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In this paper, we briefly describe our ongoing research that addresses these concerns that could ultimately lead to the development of an improved DPIA methodology capable of assessing data protection risks based on BDA technologies. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Background: The GDPR was implemented to build an overarching framework for personal data protection across the EU/EEA. Linkage of data directly collected from cohort participants, potentially serving as a prominent tool for health research, must respect data protection rules and privacy rights. Our objective was to investigate law possibilities of linking cohort data of minors with routinely collected education and health data comparing EU/EEA member states. Methods: A legal comparative analysis and scoping review was conducted of openly accessible published laws and regulations in EUR-Lex and national law databases on GDPR's implementation in Portugal, Finland, Norway, and the Netherlands and its connected national regulations purposing record linkage for health research that have been implemented up until April 30, 2021. Results: The GDPR does not ensure total uniformity in data protection legislation across member states offering flexibility for national legislation. Exceptions to process personal data, e.g., public interest and scientific research, must be laid down in EU/EEA or national law. Differences in national interpretation caused obstacles in cross-national research and record linkage: Portugal requires written consent and ethical approval; Finland allows linkage mostly without consent through the national Social and Health Data Permit Authority; Norway when based on regional ethics committee's approval and adequate information technology safeguarding confidentiality; the Netherlands mainly bases linkage on the opt-out system and Data Protection Impact Assessment. Conclusions: Though the GDPR is the most important legal framework, national legislation execution matters most when linking cohort data with routinely collected health and education data. As national interpretation varies, legal intervention balancing individual right to informational self-determination and public good is gravely needed for health research. More harmonization across EU/EEA could be helpful but should not be detrimental in those member states which already opened a leeway for registries and research for the public good without explicit consent. © 2021 Doetsch JN et al.

AB  - The application of artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed the existing notion of the health care system. The concept of AI is not new, but increasing computational power and big data, the Internet of Things, and advanced analytical power ushers in new opportunities to realize the full potential of AI. Recently, there has been an increased application of AI in the health care system, potentially raising questions about patient safety, privacy, security, and confidentiality, specifically data protection. The present study focuses on the effectiveness of the Malaysian data protection law in addressing the issue of health data protection in the wake of proliferated use of AI in the health care system. The Malaysian Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) has to face challenges in applying AI because the data processing mechanism of AI has fundamentally challenged the adequacy and sustainability of present data protection principles and associated rights of individuals. However, as nearly a decade-old law, the current PDPA requires some amendments to its provisions, for instance, the introduction of the mandatory requirement of data protection impact assessment and privacy by design for high-risk data (ie health data) processing and human involvement in automated decision-making process among others. Besides, ensuring more accountability and transparency on the part of the data users by introducing a comprehensive code of practice about the processing of health data would help data users comply with data protection legislation. © The Author(s), 2022.

AB  - Technological advancements allow biometric applications to be more omnipresent than in any other time before. This paper argues that in the current EU data protection regulation, classification applications using biometric data receive less protection compared to biometric recognition. We analyse preconditions in the regulatory language and explore how this has the potential to be the source of unique privacy risks for processing operations classifying individuals based on soft traits like emotions. This can have high impact on personal freedoms and human rights and, therefore, should be subject to data protection impact assessment.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Scholars have started to critically examine in how far EU data protection law indeed grants or is able to grant data subjects effective control over the processing of personal data con-cerning them. Data subject control, however, is not really defined in substance. In addition, there is the question whether the knowledge produced with the help of profiling and predic-tive technologies may be effectively controlled by either the data controller or the data sub-ject. The GDPR contains provisions which could be interpreted to enable data subjects to en-gage in an adversarial relationship with the data controller, giving them more negotiation power, which could lead to effectively influencing the data processing and thus some version of control. These opportunities can be found, inter alia, in the provisions on data subject rights and to a lesser extent in the provisions on stakeholder involvement when carry-ing out a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA). The discussed adversarial relationship opportunities may be found also in the LED, to a certain extent, except as concerns the DPIA. © 2022, Lexxion Verlagsgesellschaft mbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - During recent years, especially after the introduction of data protection regulations by different countries, protecting the privacy of user data has become an important research topic. Different threads of information privacy research have emerged, particularly in the areas of eliciting privacy requirements, incorporating privacy by design, performing privacy impact assessments, developing privacy enhancement techniques, implementing those techniques for privacy compliance, verifying privacy compliance, etc. Privacy engineering is integral to all phases of data lifecycle, right from privacy requirement elicitation to compliance verification. This chapter covers a brief survey of notable privacy researches and models proposed for different phases of privacy engineering (i.e., privacy requirement engineering, privacy by design, privacy impact assessment, privacy compliance, and modeling approaches for privacy in enterprise infrastructure). Models and frameworks have been chosen based on the relevance of their applicability in modeling and implementing privacy within an enterprise. © 2021, IGI Global.

AB  - Background: Surgical safety may be improved using a medical data recorder (MDR) for the purpose of postoperative team debriefing. It provides the team in the operating room (OR) with the opportunity to look back upon their joint performance objectively to discuss and learn from suboptimal situations or possible adverse events. The aim of this study was to investigate the satisfaction of the OR team using an MDR, the OR Black Box®, in the OR as a tool providing output for structured team debriefing. Methods: In this longitudinal survey study, 35 gastro-intestinal laparoscopic operations were recorded using the OR Black Box® and the output was subsequently debriefed with the operating team. Prior to study, a privacy impact assessment was conducted to ensure alignment with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. A structured debrief model and an OR Back Box® performance report was developed. A standardized survey was used to measure participant’s satisfaction with the team debriefing, the debrief model used and the performance report. Factor analysis was performed to assess the questionnaire’s quality and identified contributing satisfaction factors. Multivariable analysis was performed to identify variables associated with participants’ opinions. Results: In total, 81 team members of various disciplines in the OR participated, comprising 35 laparoscopic procedures. Mean satisfaction with the OR Black Box® performance report and team debriefing was high for all 3 identified independent satisfaction factors. Of all participants, 98% recommend using the OR Black Box® and the outcome report in team debriefing. Conclusion: The use of an MDR in the OR for the purpose of team debriefing is considered to be both beneficial and important. Team debriefing using the OR Black Box® outcome report is highly recommended by 98% of team members participating. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Addressing cyber and privacy risks has never been more critical for organisations. While a number of risk assessment methodologies and software tools are available, it is most often the case that one must, at least, integrate them into a holistic approach that combines several appropriate risk sources as input to risk mitigation tools. In addition, cyber risk assessment primarily investigates cyber risks as the consequence of vulnerabilities and threats that threaten assets of the investigated infrastructure. In fact, cyber risk assessment is decoupled from privacy impact assessment, which aims to detect privacy-specific threats and assess the degree of compliance with data protection legislation. Furthermore, a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) is conducted in a proactive manner during the design phase of a system, combining processing activities and their inter-dependencies with assets, vulnerabilities, real-time threats and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that may occur during the dynamic life-cycle of systems. In this paper, we propose a cyber and privacy risk management toolkit, called AMBIENT (Automated Cyber and Privacy Risk Management Toolkit) that addresses the above challenges by implementing and integrating three distinct software tools. AMBIENT not only assesses cyber and privacy risks in a thorough and automated manner but it also offers decision-support capabilities, to recommend optimal safeguards using the well-known repository of the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Controls. To the best of our knowledge, AMBIENT is the first toolkit in the academic literature that brings together the aforementioned capabilities. To demonstrate its use, we have created a case scenario based on information about cyber attacks we have received from a healthcare organisation, as a reference sector that faces critical cyber and privacy threats. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Digitalization is transforming healthcare institutions into complex systems in which data, applications, and devices are constantly connected and deeply intertwined. Consequently, enormous benefits can be gained both by healthcare operators and by patients; likewise, many threats have to be faced in terms of information security and data protection. In this chapter, we address such topics in the European Union legal framework analyzing the impact in the field of endorobots of the most recent regulations, notably Directive (EU) 2016/1148 (Network Information Security Directive) and Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR), and assessing potential challenges and opportunities for engineers and designers. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - What harms and consequences do patients experience after a medical data breach? This article aims at the improvement of privacy impact analysis for data breaches that involve personal medical data. The article has two major findings. First, scientific literature does not mention consequences and harms to the data subjects when discussing data breaches in the healthcare sector. For conceptualizing actual documented harm, we had to search court rulings and popular press articles instead. We present the findings of our search for empirically founded harms in the first part of the article. Second, we present a modified PRIAM assessment method with the goal of better assessment of harms and consequences of such data breaches for the patient/employee data subject in healthcare. We split the risk assessment into parallel categories of assessment rather than calculating a single risk score. In addition, we quantify the original PRIAM categories into a calculus for risk assessment. The article presents our modified PRIAM which is the result of these modifications. Our overall contribution is the collection of actual harms and consequences of e-health data breaches that complement the overly theoretical discussion in publications. With our operationalization of PRIAM and by providing a catalog of real harms examples, we focus privacy impact assessment on actual harms to persons.  © 2022 Owner/Author.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the need for new ways of thinking about data protection. This is especially so in the case of health research with children. The responsible use of children’s data plays a key role in promoting children’s well-being and securing their right to health and to privacy. In this article, we contend that a contextual approach that appropriately balances children’s legal and moral rights and interests is needed when thinking about data protection issues with children. We examine three issues in health research through a child-focused lens: consent to data processing, data retention, and data protection impact assessments. We show that these issues present distinctive concerns for children and that the General Data Protection Regulation provides few bright-line rules. We contend that there is an opportunity for creative approaches to children’s data protection when child-specific principles, such as the best interests of the child and the child’s right to be heard, are put into dialogue with the structure and logic of data protection law. © Copyright © 2021 Beauvais and Knoppers.

AB  - Corpora of speech of individuals with communication disorders (CSD) are invaluable resources for education and research, but they are costly and hard to build and difficult to share for various reasons. DELAD, which means ‘shared’ in Swedish, is a project initiated by Professors Nicole Müller and Martin Ball in 2015 that aims to address this issue by establishing a platform for researchers to share datasets of speech disorders with interested audiences. To date four workshops have been held, where selected participants, covering various expertise including researchers in clinical phonetics and linguistics, speech and language therapy, infrastructure specialists, and ethics and legal specialists, participated to discuss relevant issues in setting up such an archive. Positive and steady progress has been made since 2015, including refurbishing the DELAD website (http://delad.net/) with information and application forms for researchers to join and share their datasets and linking with the CLARIN K-Centre for Atypical Communication Expertise (https://ace.ruhosting.nl/) where CSD can be hosted and accessed through the CLARIN B-Centres, The Language Archive (https://tla.mpi.nl/tools/tla-tools/) and TalkBank (https://talkbank.org/). The latest workshop, which was funded by CLARIN (Common Language Resources and Technology Infrastructure) was held as an online event in January 2021 on topics including Data Protection Impact Assessments, reviewing changes in ethics perspectives in academia on sharing CSD, and voice conversion as a mean to pseudonomise speech. This paper reports the latest progress of DELAD and discusses the directions for further advance of the initiative, with information on how researchers can contribute to the repository. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Advances in artificial intelligence, smart sensors, data mining, and other fields of ICT have resulted in a plethora of research projects aimed at harnessing these technologies, for example to generate new knowledge about diseases, to develop systems for better management of chronic diseases, and to assist the elderly with independent living. While the algorithms themselves can be developed using anonymized or synthetic data, conducting a pilot study is often one of the key components of a research project, and such studies unavoidably involve actual users with their personal data. Although one of the derogations stipulated in Article 89 of the GDPR is related to the data processed for scientific purposes, the GDPR still is applicable to that processing in a broader interpretation. The computer scientists and engineers working in research projects may not always be fully familiar with all the details of the GDPR, a close collaboration with a lawyer specialized in the European data protection legislation is highly beneficial for the success of a project. In this paper, we consider a hypothetical research project developed by an engineer dealing with sensitive personal data and a lawyer conducting Data Protection Impact Assessment to ensure legality and quality of the research project. © 2020 Slovene Society Informatika.

AB  - Big Data Analytics enables today's businesses and organisations to process and utilise the raw data that is generated on a daily basis. While Big Data Analytics has improved efficiency and created many opportunities, it has also increased the risk of personal data being compromised or breached. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) mandates Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) as a means of identifying appropriate controls to mitigate risks associated with the protection of personal data. However, little is currently known about how to conduct such a DPIA in a Big Data Analytics context. To this end, we conducted a systematic literature review with the aim of identifying privacy and data protection risks specific to the Big Data Analytics context that could negatively impact individuals' rights and freedoms when they occur. Based on a sample of 159 articles, we applied a thematic analysis to all identified risks which resulted in the definition of nine Privacy Touch Points that summarise the identified risks. The coverage of these Privacy Touch Points was then analysed for ten Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) methodologies. The insights gained from our analysis will inform the next phase of our research, in which we aim to develop a comprehensive DPIA methodology that will enable data processors and data controllers to identify, analyse and mitigate privacy and data protection risks when storing and processing data involving Big Data Analytics. © 2021 Georgios Georgiadis and Geert Poels

AB  - A cyber-risk assessment conducted in a large organization may lead to heterogeneous results due to the subjectivity of certain aspects of the evaluation, especially those concerning the negative consequences (impact) of a cyber-incident. To address this problem, we propose an approach based on the identification of a set of sensitivity features, i.e. certain attributes of the assets or processing activities that are strongly related to the levels of impact of cyber-incidents. We apply our approach to revise the results of a Data Protection Impact Assessment, a mandatory activity for complying with GDPR, conducted in a medium-to-large organization of the Italian Public Administration, and we obtain encouraging results. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation within the European Union intensifies regulatory requirements in terms of data protection for Smart City services. In particular, the mandatory Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) process constitutes a complex managerial challenge. To reduce the complexity, this study develops a typology of Flemish Smart City services based on DPIA costs. Our explorative case study, based on face-to-face interviews and a workshop, shows that DPIA costs vary along the complexities of i) the urban environment in which a Smart City service is provided, and ii) the Smart City service itself. The research further demonstrates that these complexities represent multilayered concepts. The complexity of the urban environment consists of three layers: i) city size, ii) diversity of urban stakeholders, and iii) total of Smart City services in the urban region. Similarly, the complexity of the Smart City service is composed of five layers: i) number of different data streams, ii) clarity of data ownership, iii) amount of use-cases, iv) privacy invasiveness, and v) visibility of the Smart City service. While most layers of the respective complexities unequivocally matter in the eyes of the experts, others are more contested, such as the size of the city and the visibility of the Smart City service. This cost-based framework is of value to city administrations and Smart City service providers as it allows them to make the DPIA process more efficient by shortening the learning curve and improving decision making by clustering services based on data protection needs. In particular, stakeholders that have little expertise in-house, and that are looking for an easy-to-understand, rational framework can benefit from these results. Furthermore, based on both the literature review and the obtained results, our systematic data protection impact-cost-approach is generalizable beyond the EU-borders. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was widely seen as a significant step towards enhancing data protection and privacy. Unlike previous legislation, adherence to GDPR required organizations to assume greater responsibility for cybersecurity with respect to data processing. This shift represented a profound transformation in how businesses retain, use, manage, and protect data. However, despite these innovative aspects, the actual implementation of the GDPR security side poses some challenges. This paper attempts to identify positive and negative aspects of GDPR requirements and presents a new framework for analyzing them from a security point of view. Firstly, it provides an overview of the most significant scholarly perspectives on GDPR and cybersecurity. Secondly, it presents a systematic roadmap analysis and discussion of the requirements of GDPR in relation to cybersecurity. Results show that some of the GDPR security controls, such as the Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA), records on processing, and the appointment of a Data Protection Officer (DPO), are some of the most critical from a security viewpoint. Finally, it provides recommendations for tackling these challenges in the evolving compliance landscape. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - This paper reassess the evaluation of ethical, legal and social issues (ELSI) in relation to the agile development of information systems in the domain of crisis management. The authors analyse the differing assessment needs of a move from a traditional approach to the development of information systems to an agile approach, which offers flexibility, adaptability and responds to the needs of users as the system develops. In turn, the authors argue that this development requires greater flexibility and an iterative approach to assessing ELSI. The authors provide an example from the Horizon 2020 EU-funded project iTRACK (Integrated system for real-time TRACKing and collective intelligence in civilian humanitarian missions) to exemplify this move to an iterative approach in practice, drawing on the process of undertaking an ethical and privacy impact assessment for the purpose of this project. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - When reflecting upon the role of law as an instrument influencing urban planning and shaping urban environments, the most immediate link is to environmental and urban legislation. Nevertheless, data protection law is increasingly expected to affect the future development of urban realities in the European Union (EU). Being actual "data cities", current smart cities have been significantly affected by the entry into force of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In particular, the Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is increasingly portraited as a solution to address the countless fundamental rights challenges arising from the personal data processing operations occurring in the context of smart cities, inter alia due to its participatory element. However, is DPIA a suitable approach to making smart cities more inclusive, and specifically to empower women of diverse races, backgrounds, sexual orientations and abilities? Enquiry into the ways in which smart cities, where urban and data protection challenges merge, might exacerbate dynamics of oppression against women, and how European data protection law could address these challenges, is still lacking. The objective of this article is to begin such a discussion. © 2022 Nordregio. All rights reserved.

AB  - Among the numerous challenges that organisations face, information security is undoubtedly an important concern, and as of lately, compliance with personal data regulation (e.g., the General Data Protection Regulation – GDPR in the EU) is a necessity, while requirements for privacy-by-design need also to be met. This paper proposes a comprehensive method to support the identification, modelling, (re)design, implementation, and realisation of privacy aware/compliant business processes, in order to incorporate personal data protection principles into all work practices and business processes in an organisation. More specifically, this method integrates the main steps of a Data Protection Impact Assessment into business process management, to ensure the identification of personal data flow throughout the organisation and support the assessment of privacy-related risks and enhance personal data protection. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - With many million users across all age groups and income levels, video games have become the world's leading entertainment industry. Behind the fun experience they provide, it goes largely unnoticed that modern game devices pose a serious threat to consumer privacy. To illustrate the industry's potential for illegitimate surveillance and user profiling, this article offers a classification of data types commonly gathered by video games. Drawing from patents and literature of diverse disciplines, it is also discussed how patterns and correlations in collected gameplay data may leak additional information in ways not easily understood or anticipated by the user. This includes inferences about a user's biometric identity, age, gender, emotions, skills, interests, consumption habits, and personality traits. Based on these findings, it is argued that video games need to be brought into the focus of privacy research and discourse. Considering the granularity and enormous scale of the data collection taking place, this industry deserves the same level of scrutiny as other digital services, such as search engines, dating apps, or social media platforms. The knowledge compiled in this article can serve as a basis for privacy impact assessments, consumer education, and further research into the societal impact of video games. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - After the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) entered into force, the topic of overseas transfer of personal data for purposes of storage and processing has gained visibility and prominence in both the privacy impact assessments and the informed consent forms issued by EEA based organisations. Related compliance issues have been exacerbated by a 2020 ruling of the European Court of Justice, which upheld the adoption by US based providers of Standard Contract Clauses to safeguard the data subjects' rights of EEA citizens whose personal data is stored or processed on their platforms. A little explored set of privacy issues materializes when data flows take the opposite direction: i.e. gathered/stored outside and shared/processed inside the EEA space. This paper takes such perspective to examine, in a comparative fashion, the similarities and distinctions between the GDPR provisions and the privacy regimes of China, US and UK (after Brexit), each of them undertaking a process of transformation, and convergence towards GDPR, although with different approaches and pathways. The topic can be of interest for research or service teams engaged in multi-country data gathering, a trend one may expect to grow in the future.  © 2021 Croatian Society MIPRO.

AB  - With the gradual acceleration of the global digitalization process, data has now become an important factor of production in society. The flow of data has created infinite value for the society, but it also has huge hidden privacy risks. With the introduction of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), personal data security has become a sensitive topic in the era of big data, and it has been paid more and more attention by researchers. Firstly, we review the development of data privacy security, introduce the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and analyze its applications and influences. Secondly, we summarize the domestical and abroad related research literatures in recent years. We divide the GDPR compliance into three aspects: GDPR violation analysis, privacy policy analysis and GDPR model framework, and analyze the research status of these three aspects. We analyze the data technology based on GDPR, and discuss the application of GDPR in specific fields such as blockchain and Internet of Things respectively. Finally, according to the limitations of the existing research work, we summarize the main challenges and opportunities of data privacy security research based on GDPR, and put forward some inspirations for data privacy protection in China. © 2022, Science Press.

AB  - Data Protection is concerned with the processing of personal information of individuals within a regulated sphere, taking into account protected rights. It principally underscores that the operations of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) should be in an environment that appreciates the established canons of data protection. UAS operations pose a potential threat to an individual’s privacy, the human right that anchors the protection of personal data. This article examines what the present and future hold for data protection impact assessment (DPIA) in regulation of UAS. The article discusses the impact that the history of UAS Regulation has had on the regulation on data protection challenges. It then proceeds to highlight how the data protection agenda took a significant place in the UAS regulation in other areas and in Kenya. Towards this end, an assessment of the legal development is made. Even then, it does appear that, despite this milestone in UAS technology and law, regulators still have to contend with many issues on how to approach the sacrosanct element of privacy in UAS operations. Against this backdrop, this article sees into the future and suggests how the emerging practice and policy on DPIA as a risk-based strategy can be harnessed and streamlined to minimize the exposure related to processing of personal data by the UAS operators or in the course of UAS operations. Among many others, this article finds that UAS operators, who can be categorized as either data controllers or data processors, are, therefore, required to interrogate their mandate in ensuring that they are in full compliance with the law © 2022 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands

AB  - The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires that developers exercise due diligence and implement Data Protection by Design and Default (DPbD). Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) are recommended as a general heuristic. However, developers are not well equipped to deal with legal texts. Privacy engineering shifts the emphasis from interpreting texts and guidelines, or consulting legal experts, to embedding data protection within the development process itself. We present a privacy-oriented, flow-based integrated development environment (IDE) that enables due diligence in the construction of domestic IoT applications. The IDE (a) helps developers reason about personal data during the actual construction of IoT applications; (b) advises developers as to whether or not their design choices warrant a DPIA and (c) attach and make available to other relevant parties specific privacy-related information about an application. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2021.

AB  - The General Data Protection Regulation requires, where possible, to seek data subjects perception. Studies showed that people do not have a correct privacy risk perception. In this paper, we study how lay people perceive privacy risks once they are made aware and if experts can differentiate between security and privacy risks.

AB  - Privacy enhancing technologies allow the minimization of risks to online data. However, the transparency of the minimization process is not so clear to all types of end users. Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) is a standardized tool that identifies and assesses privacy risks associated with the use of a system. In this work, we used the results of the PIA conducted in our use case to visualize privacy risks to end users in the form of User Interface (UI) mock ups. We tested and evaluated the UI mock-ups via walkthroughs to investigate users’ interests by observing their clicking behavior, followed by four focus group workshops. There were 13 participants (two expert groups and two lay user groups) in total. Results reveal general interests in the transparency provided by showing the risks reductions. Generally, although participants appreciate the concept of having detailed information provided about risk reductions and the type of risks, the visualization and usability of the PIA UIs require future development. Specifically, it should be tailored to the target group’s mental models and background knowledge. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Sharing research data between researchers is becoming a requirement for open science in the field of clinical phonetics and speech and language pathology. An initiative entitled DELAD was started in 2015 to provide researchers a platform to discuss ongoing technical, legal and ethics issues related to sharing recordings of speech disorders, and to assist them in archiving their data for sharing with colleagues in the field. The ultimate goal of data sharing is to enhance research and teaching in the area of speech disorders. This paper first presents DELAD and its history and previous accomplishments. Then the recent work achieved by the DELAD steering group in providing information or recommendations in three areas are discussed: (1) speech annotation and automatic annotation mining, (2) consent and data storage, and (3) a role-play activity for learning data protection assessment. DELAD is an active community and researchers who share similar interests are welcome to join the (ad)venture. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Roboticists are grappling with how to address privacy in robot design at a time when regulatory frameworks around the world increasingly require systems to be engineered to preserve and protect privacy. This paper surveys the top robotics journals and conferences over the past four decades to identify contributions with respect to privacy in robot design. Our survey revealed that less than half of one percent of the ~89,120 papers in our study even mention the word privacy. Herein, we propose privacy preserving approaches for roboticists to employ in robot design, including, assessing a robot's purpose and environment; ensuring privacy by design by selecting sensors that do not collect information that is not essential to the core objectives of that robot; embracing both privacy and performance as fundamental design challenges to be addressed early in the robot lifecycle; and performing privacy impact assessments. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - The large increase in the collection of location, communication, health data etc. from seized digital devices like mobile phones, tablets, IoT devices, laptops etc. often poses serious privacy risks. To measure privacy risks, privacy impact assessments (PIA) are substantially useful tools and the Directive EU 2016/80 (Police Directive) requires their use. While much has been said about PIA methods pursuant to the Regulation EU 2016/679 (GDPR), less has been said about PIA methods pursuant to the Police Directive. Yet, little research has been done to explore and measure privacy risks that are specific to law enforcement activities which necessitate the processing of large amounts of data. This study tries to fill this gap by conducting a PIA on a big data forensic platform as a case study. This study also answers the question how a PIA should be carried out for large-scale digital forensic operations and describes the privacy risks, threats we learned from conducting it. Finally, it articulates concrete privacy measures to demonstrate compliance with the Police Directive. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - On June 15, 2020, the official data protection impact assessment (DPIA) for the German Corona-Warn-App (CWA) was made publicly available. Shortly thereafter, the app was made available for download in the app stores. However, the first version of the DPIA had significant weaknesses, as this paper argues. However since then, the quality of the official DPIA increased immensely due to interventions and interactions such as an alternative DPIA produced by external experts and extensive public discussions. To illustrate the development and improvement, the initial weaknesses of the official DPIA are documented and analyzed here. For this paper to meaningfully do this, first the purpose of a DPIA is briefly summarized. According to Article 35 of the GDPR, it consists primarily of identifying the risks to the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons. This paper documents at least specific methodological, technical and legal shortcomings of the initial DPIA of the CWA: 1) It only focused on the app itself, neither on the whole processing procedure nor on the infrastructure used. 2) It only briefly touched on the main data protection specific attacker, the processing organization itself. And 3) The discussion of effective safeguards to all risks including such as the ones posed by Google and Apple has only insufficiently been worked out. Finally, this paper outlines the constructive criticism and suggestions uttered, also by the authors of this paper, regarding the initial release. As of now, some of those constructive contributions have been worked into the current DPIA, such as 1) and 2), but some central ones still haven’t, such as 3). This paper aims to provide an opportunity to improve the practical knowledge and academic discourse regarding high-quality DPIAs. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - This chapter examines the interplay between the GDPR and parallel private regulation in the form of privacy-related standards adopted by the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO). Focusing on the understanding of ‘risks’ in the GDPR and ISO respective ecosystems, it compares the GDPR requirement for Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) with ISO/IEC 29134:2017, a private standard on Privacy Impact Assessment explicitly referred to by EU Data Protection Authorities as relevant in the context of DPIA methods. The resulting gap analysis identifies and maps misalignments, critically reflecting on whether the parallel form of ISO regulation, in the context of DPIAs, could support or rather blurs GDPR’s objective to protect fundamental rights by embracing a risks-based approach. © 2021, IGI Global.

AB  - In R (on the application of Bridges) v Chief Constable of South Wales Police the Court of Appeal held the deployment of live automated facial recognition technology (AFR) by the South Wales Police Force (SWP) unlawful on three grounds. It violated the right to respect for private life under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights because it lacked a suitable basis in law; the Data Protection Impact Assessment carried out under section 64 of the Data Protection Act 2018 was deficient for failing to assess the risks to the rights and freedoms of individuals processed by the system; and SWP failed to fulfil the Public Service Equality Duty imposed by section 149 of the Equality Act 2010 by failing to assess whether or not the software used in the AFR system was biased in relation to sex and race. © 2021 The Author.

AB  - This paper provides the results of the privacy impact assessment conducted for the PROACTIVE solutions and its subsequent privacy by design integration process. PROACTIVE is a solution for fostering coordination and communication between stakeholders before and during CBRNe events focusing on providing guidance to vulnerable populations. Based on extensive fieldwork activities with practitioners and vulnerable groups, the results of the analysis reveal the main risk focus, including the need to filter data by competent authorities (data controllers) and potential solutions for each of them, which allow establishing standard procedures for systems used in similar contexts. © 2023, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.

AB  - In this paper, we critically examine the effectiveness of the requirement to conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) in Article 35 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in light of fairness metrics. Through this analysis, we explore the role of the fairness principle as introduced in Article 5(1)(a) and its multifaceted interpretation in the obligation to conduct a DPIA. Our paper argues that although there is a significant theoretical role for the considerations of fairness in the DPIA process, an analysis of the various guidance documents issued by data protection authorities on the obligation to conduct a DPIA reveals that they rarely mention the fairness principle in practice. Our analysis questions this omission, and assesses the capacity of fairness metrics to be truly operationalized within DPIAs. We conclude by exploring the practical effectiveness of DPIA with particular reference to (1) technical challenges that have an impact on the usefulness of DPIAs irrespective of a controller's willingness to actively engage in the process, (2) the context dependent nature of the fairness principle, and (3) the key role played by data controllers in the determination of what is fair. © 2021 ACM.

AB  - An increasing number of mental health services are now offered through mobile health (mHealth) systems, such as in mobile applications (apps). Although there is an unprecedented growth in the adoption of mental health services, partly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns about data privacy risks due to security breaches are also increasing. Whilst some studies have analyzed mHealth apps from different angles, including security, there is relatively little evidence for data privacy issues that may exist in mHealth apps used for mental health services, whose recipients can be particularly vulnerable. This paper reports an empirical study aimed at systematically identifying and understanding data privacy incorporated in mental health apps. We analyzed 27 top-ranked mental health apps from Google Play Store. Our methodology enabled us to perform an in-depth privacy analysis of the apps, covering static and dynamic analysis, data sharing behaviour, server-side tests, privacy impact assessment requests, and privacy policy evaluation. Furthermore, we mapped the findings to the LINDDUN threat taxonomy, describing how threats manifest on the studied apps. The findings reveal important data privacy issues such as unnecessary permissions, insecure cryptography implementations, and leaks of personal data and credentials in logs and web requests. There is also a high risk of user profiling as the apps’ development do not provide foolproof mechanisms against linkability, detectability and identifiability. Data sharing among 3rd-parties and advertisers in the current apps’ ecosystem aggravates this situation. Based on the empirical findings of this study, we provide recommendations to be considered by different stakeholders of mHealth apps in general and apps developers in particular. We conclude that while developers ought to be more knowledgeable in considering and addressing privacy issues, users and health professionals can also play a role by demanding privacy-friendly apps. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Privacy in Electronic Health Records (EHR) has become a significant concern in today’s rapidly changing world, particularly for personal and sensitive user data. The sheer volume and sensitive nature of patient records require healthcare providers to exercise an intense quantity of caution during EHR implementation. In recent years, various healthcare providers have been hit by ransomware and distributed denial of service attacks, halting many emergency services during COVID-19. Personal data breaches are becoming more common day by day, and privacy concerns are often raised when sharing data across a network, mainly due to transparency and security issues. To tackle this problem, various researchers have proposed privacy-preserving solutions for EHR. However, most solutions do not extensively use Privacy by Design (PbD) mechanisms, distributed data storage and sharing when designing their frameworks, which is the emphasis of this study. To design a framework for Privacy by Design in Electronic Health Records (PbDinEHR) that can preserve the privacy of patients during data collection, storage, access and sharing, we have analysed the fundamental principles of privacy by design and privacy design strategies, and the compatibility of our proposed healthcare principles with Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA), Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). To demonstrate the proposed framework, ‘PbDinEHR’, we have implemented a Patient Record Management System (PRMS) to create interfaces for patients and healthcare providers. In addition, to provide transparency and security for sharing patients’ medical files with various healthcare providers, we have implemented a distributed file system and two permission blockchain networks using the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Ethereum blockchain. This allows us to expand the proposed privacy by design mechanisms in the future to enable healthcare providers, patients, imaging labs and others to share patient-centric data in a transparent manner. The developed framework has been tested and evaluated to ensure user performance, effectiveness, and security. The complete solution is expected to provide progressive resistance in the face of continuous data breaches in the patient information domain. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - In recent years, academics and professionals witness the rise of the “ethification” of law, specifically in the area of ICT law. Ethification shall be understood as a proliferation of moral principles and moral values in the legal discourse within the areas of research, innovation governance, or directly enforceable rules in the industry. Although the ethical considerations may seem distant from mere regulatory compliance, the opposite is true. The article focuses on the positive side of the “ethification” of digital laws through the lens of legal requirements for impact assessments pursuant to General Data Protection Regulation and conformity assessments in the proposal for the Artificial Intelligence Act. Authors argue that ethical considerations are often absent in the context of using new technologies including artificial intelligence, yet they may provide additional value for organizations and society as a whole. Additionally, carrying out ethics-based assessments is already in line with existing regulatory requirements in the fields of data protection law and proposed EU AI regulation. These arguments are reflected in the context of facial recognition technology, where both data protection impact assessment under the EU General Data Protection Regulation and conformity assessment under the proposal of the EU Artificial Intelligence Act will be mandatory. Facial recognition technology is analyzed through the ethics-based assessment involving stakeholder analysis, data flows map, and identification of risks and respective countermeasures to show additional insights that ethics provides beyond regulatory requirements. © 2023 Matúš Mesarčík, Juraj Podroužek, Adrián Gavorník

AB  - Since SARS-CoV-2 started spreading in Europe in early 2020, there has been a strong call for technical solutions to combat or contain the pandemic, with contact tracing apps at the heart of the debates. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires controllers to carry out a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) where their data processing is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms (Art. 35 GDPR). A DPIA is a structured risk analysis that identifies and evaluates possible consequences of data processing relevant to fundamental rights in advance and describes the measures envisaged to address these risks or expresses the inability to do so.Based on the Standard Data Protection Model (SDM), we present the results of a scientific and methodologically clear DPIA. It shows that even a decentralized architecture involves numerous serious weaknesses and risks, including larger ones still left unaddressed in current implementations. It also found that none of the proposed designs operates on anonymous data or ensures proper anonymisation. It also showed that informed consent would not be a legitimate legal ground for the processing. For all points where data subjects' rights are still not sufficiently safeguarded, we briefly outline solutions.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - In the absence of a specific treatment or vaccines, public health strategies are the main measures to use in the initial stages of a pandemic to allow surveillance of infectious diseases. During the ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), several countries initi-ated various public health strategies, such as contact tracing and quarantine. The present study aims to conduct a systematic literature review to identify the presence of educational initiatives that promote the implementation of public health strategies before public health emergencies, with a special focus on contact tracing applications. Using Science Direct, PubMed, Scopus, and Gothenburg University search engines, all published scientific articles were included, while conference, reports, and non-scientific papers were excluded. The outcomes of the reviewed studies indicate that the effective implementation of public health strategies depends on the peoples’ willingness to participate and collaborate with local authorities. Several factors may influence such willingness, of which eth-ical, psychological, and practical factors seem to be the most important and frequently discussed. Moreover, individual willingness and readiness of a community may also vary based on the ac-quired level of knowledge about the incident and its cause and available management options. Educational initiatives, proper communication, and timely information at the community level were found to be the necessary steps to counteract misinformation and to promote a successful implementation of public health strategies and attenuate the effects of a pandemic. The systematic review conducted as a part of this study would benefit the relevant stakeholders and policy makers and assist with effective designing and implementation. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Cybersecurity risk management consists of several steps including the selection of appropriate controls to minimize risks. This is a difficult task that requires to search through all possible subsets of a set of available controls and identify those that minimize the risks of all stakeholders. Since stakeholders may have different perceptions of the risks (especially when considering the impact of threats), conflicting goals may arise that require to find the best possible trade-offs among the various needs. In this work, we propose a quantitative and (semi-)automated approach to solve this problem based on the well-known notion of Pareto optimality. For validation, we show how a prototype tool based on our approach can assist in the Data Protection Impact Assessment mandated by the General Data Protection Regulation on a simplified—but realistic—use case scenario. We also evaluate the scalability of the approach by conducting an experimental evaluation with the prototype with encouraging results. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Potent and novel technological applications are taking on an increasingly prominent role in data analytics, public policy, and law enforcement. These tools not only allow for the efficient management of resources and implementation of data-driven strategies but also introduce various legal and ethical challenges concerning the rights of individuals and the integrity of police operations. As such, European data protection law prescribes the use of a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) to identify and address issues associated with high-risk instances of data processing. Yet despite the severity of the risks posed by far-reaching data analytics in law enforcement and criminal justice, comparatively little attention has been paid to evaluating or guiding the DPIA process in this sphere. This contribution explores the importance of DPIAs in contemporary police practice where algorithmic and analytical tools exert a growing degree of influence on decision-making processes. It provides an overview of the relevant legal framework, examines key aspects of a police DPIA, and illustrates the importance of the process by exploring recent case law. Following this, it highlights key legal and ethical challenges from a law enforcement perspective and assesses the suitability of concrete mitigation strategies to establish best practices. © 2023 The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

AB  - The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation tasks organizations to perform a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) to consider fundamental rights risks of their artificial intelligence (AI) system. However, assessing risks can be challenging, as fundamental rights are often considered abstract in nature. So far, guidance regarding DPIAs has largely focussed on data protection, leaving broader fundamental rights aspects less elaborated. This is problematic because potential negative societal consequences of AI systems may remain unaddressed and damage public trust in organizations using AI. Towards this, we introduce a practical, four-Phased framework, assisting organizations with performing fundamental rights impact assessments. This involves organizations (i) defining the system’s purposes and tasks, and the responsibilities of parties involved in the AI system; (ii) assessing the risks regarding the system’s development; (iii) justifying why the risks of potential infringements on rights are proportionate; and (iv) adopt organizational and/or technical measures mitigating risks identified. We further indicate how regulators might support these processes with practical guidance. © The Author(s) 2022. Published by Oxford University Press.

AB  - One needs to look only at recent data breaches to be reminded of the severe and far-reaching damage caused by privacy threats. In light of these threats, global healthcare leaders are striving to understand how to protect patient information without the loss of benefits (utility) that results from privacy-preserving mechanisms. Consequently, our study examines the relatively unexplored issue of simultaneously responding to information privacy threats and maintaining utility in a healthcare privacy compliance context. Counterintuitively, we also identify a symbiotic relationship between these two focal and interdependent efforts. We adopt an interpretive qualitative research method leveraging the value-focused thinking (VFT) approach which results in two major contributions: (1) the development of a value-driven framework presented as a means-end objective network providing a list of 16 means objectives and seven key fundamental objectives enabling higher-quality privacy decision making vis-à-vis privacy and utility. Our second and central contribution (2) is a theoretical framework of privacy impact assessment (PIA) emphasising the interplay and balance between making appropriate decisions in responding to information privacy while not hindering healthcare operations. This work provides the foundation for proposing four compelling propositions for future healthcare privacy research. © The Operational Research Society 2022.

AB  - Since 2018, EU data protection law requires a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) for any data processing that involves high risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. This paper examines the possibilities for transparent and fundamental rights-protecting policing that this legal framework offers. Many politicians and police officials tend to place more emphasis on security than on transparency, democratic accountability of policing, and high standards of privacy. This can be counteracted by higher transparency standards in police data processing and by designing technology based on privacy by design. © 2020, Oekom Verlag. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Data processing of health research databases often requires a Data Protection Impact Assessment to evaluate the severity of the risk and the appropriateness of measures taken to comply with the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We aimed to define and apply a comprehensive method for the evaluation of privacy, data governance and ethics among research networks involved in the EU Project Bridge Health. Methods Computerised survey among associated partners of main EU Consortia, using a targeted instrument designed by the principal investigator and progressively refined in collaboration with an international advisory panel. Descriptive measures using the percentage of adoption of privacy, data governance and ethical principles as main endpoints were used for the analysis and interpretation of the results. Results A total of 15 centres provided relevant information on the processing of sensitive data from 10 European countries. Major areas of concern were noted for: data linkage (median, range of adoption: 45%, 30%-80%), access and accuracy of personal data (50%, 0%-100%) and anonymisation procedures (56%, 11%-100%). A high variability was noted in the application of privacy principles. Conclusions A comprehensive methodology of Privacy and Ethics Impact and Performance Assessment was successfully applied at international level. The method can help implementing the GDPR and expanding the scope of Data Protection Impact Assessment, so that the public benefit of the secondary use of health data could be well balanced with the respect of personal privacy. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

AB  - Nowadays, information systems are evolving towards increasingly interconnected, smart, and self‐adaptive models. This transformation has led to the representation of the systems themselves in terms of natural ecosystems. Similar to the natural environment, the virtual world can be threatened by specific forms of pollution, such as illegitimate access to the system, unwanted changes to data, and loss of information, which affect the only resource it possesses, i.e., data. In order to provide proactive protection of data integrity and confidentiality, in this paper we consider the well‐known principles of privacy by design and privacy by default in the design phase of system development. To this end, we propose an approach based on axiomatic design, which allows us to implement these two principles through an appropriate reinterpretation of the information axiom, in terms of privacy impact assessment. We illustrate our approach by a case study, which implements the process of managing patients in home care. However, the proposed method can be applied to processing systems that provide services. The main result achieved is to select the most digitally sustainable design solution, i.e., the one that best prevents the threats mentioned above. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Social media data are being increasingly used in conservation science to study human–nature interactions. User-generated content, such as images, video, text, and audio, and the associated metadata can be used to assess such interactions. A number of social media platforms provide free access to user-generated social media content. However, similar to any research involving people, scientific investigations based on social media data require compliance with highest standards of data privacy and data protection, even when data are publicly available. Should social media data be misused, the risks to individual users' privacy and well-being can be substantial. We investigated the legal basis for using social media data while ensuring data subjects’ rights through a case study based on the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation. The risks associated with using social media data in research include accidental and purposeful misidentification that has the potential to cause psychological or physical harm to an identified person. To collect, store, protect, share, and manage social media data in a way that prevents potential risks to users involved, one should minimize data, anonymize data, and follow strict data management procedure. Risk-based approaches, such as a data privacy impact assessment, can be used to identify and minimize privacy risks to social media users, to demonstrate accountability and to comply with data protection legislation. We recommend that conservation scientists carefully consider our recommendations in devising their research objectives so as to facilitate responsible use of social media data in conservation science research, for example, in conservation culturomics and investigations of illegal wildlife trade online. © 2021 Society for Conservation Biology

AB  - There is now a flourishing but confusing debate about the ethics of artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies that use data extensively and intensively. There is a rush to define principles and frameworks for these activities, including the research that underlies innovations. This article illustrates and explores some of the perspectives, proposals, inventories and other materials that comprise these efforts. It begins with a look at the current interest in research ethics, and then highlights and comments on examples of the ethical frameworks, principles, and other schemes that have recently appeared. It then considers impact assessment of various kinds, especially regarding data-driven technologies, in which ethical and social issues or values are to the fore. It ends by touching on some issues that relate to attempts to devise ways of dealing with the adverse effects of advanced technologies and systems, including governance and the making of ethics-based judgments. © 2020

AB  - Regulation (EU) 2016/679, like Law nº 58/2019, brings with it an important innovation under the terms of article 37 of the RGPD, the person responsible and the subcontractor having, in most cases, to appoint a Protection Officer (DPO) internal or external to the Organization. An expert in the practice of privacy and data protection. To consolidate the role of the DPO, we suggest, in this article, a new methodology for implementing GDPR compliance in an organization, where the focus is placed on privacy and security, from conception—“Data Protection by Design”, and by default—“De-sign by Default”, and capable of mitigating the risk of data breach (Data Breach). This new model, called Canvas GDPR model, is a methodological proposal for governance, privacy and protection of personal data that will help design the organization’s compliance with the GDPR (Data Protection Impact Assessment), but also guarantees the “accountability” of the organization’s business model with the rights of Data subjects. The model was validated and applied in a social housing organization. In this research work, it was proved that the Canvas GDPR model is a strategic and entrepreneurial tool, very useful for the DPO, nicknamed Chief Privacy Officer (CPI) or Data Protection Officer (DPO), in the translation not very well achieved to Data Protection Officer (EPD). © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Personal data is used to define customer requirements. Organizations should securely collect and process such data, using data protection policies aligned with the applicable regulations. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), an EU data protection law, has include a data protection assessment method called Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) to ensure personal data security. The maritime industry is also concerned about personal data protection. However, there is a still a lack of practical methods to assess data protection risks. This article aims to introduce the conceptual framework for a new method for risk assessment in maritime systems, using DPIA and various systems-theoretic risk approaches as a conceptual basis. The ICT system is a central system in which personal data is utilized in the architecture of maritime systems. In this article, this system will be taken as a basis for illustrating the newly proposed method for personal data security risk assessment in a DPIA context. The conceptual framework will be further concretized and tested in follow-up research.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - On 20 May 2021, the European Commission, Council and Parliament announced a breakthrough in the trialogue negotiations to establish the European Union (EU) Digital COVID Certificate. Originally, this standardisation effort was labelled as Digital Green Certificate and - [i]n view of the urgency - presented without a data protection impact assessment. It should allow citizens and residents of Member States to prove that they are either vaccinated against COVID-19, have recently tested negative or are currently immune against the virus. This article considers the proposal from a privacy perspective, taking into account the opinion of EU data protection authorities, ongoing negotiations in the EU institutions and relevant developments on the national and international level. While the European Parliament and others tried to improve the original Commission proposal, questions around the appropriateness and effectiveness of the framework remain. The technological and organisational implementation is essentially left to Member States, who already have started to develop their own tracing and identification systems. ©

AB  - Privacy needs to be secured in cellular networks. In the domain of telecommunications, privacy attributes to personal information and subscriber identity. In service providing organizations, privacy impact assessment is performed to identify possible risks to business operations of the organizations caused by collecting personally identifiable information and to ensure compliance with applicable legal, regulatory and policy requirements for privacy protection. However, privacy risks can be estimated not only from organizations' business but also from customers' perspectives. While there are many tools, techniques and templates available assisting organizations in performing privacy impact assessments, the subscribers,' in most cases subjective, perspective on privacy risks has not attracted too much attention by research communities. The paper intends to show the existence of the gap and to contribute towards the understanding of privacy aspects of LTE and 5G networks from subscribers' perspective. This paper first outlines the main vulnerabilities that can be exploited to violate subscriber privacy in LTE networks. Then, controls to mitigate privacy risks in 5G networks are evaluated. The paper also discusses privacy risks introduced by new technologies, including software defined networking (SDN), network function virtualization (NFV) and cloud computing in 5G networks. The privacy risk assessment in LTE and 5G networks is performed from the perspective of customers, not from the perspective of service providers. Protection of subscriber's privacy in the 6G networks is also briefly discussed.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Background Consultations before and after bariatric surgery should include structured assessments of patients' health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and mental health. One way to conduct this assessment is to implement patient-reported outcome monitoring with a clinical feedback system (PRO/CFS). Aim We will explore patients' and healthcare professionals' experiences when a PRO/CFS is an integrated part of bariatric surgery care. Methods and analyses This is a design paper in which a PRO/CFS will be implemented in two bariatric outpatient clinics. All patients who have an appointment with a healthcare professional prior to, and 3 and 12 months after surgery, will be asked to complete six digital questionnaires measuring HRQOL, mental health, bowel symptoms and eating self-efficacy prior to each consultation. A digital summary report generated from the patient's responses will form the basis for the clinical consultation. A team of patient representatives, healthcare professionals and researchers will be involved in all phases of designing the PRO/CFS to ensure its relevance for clinical consultations. The patients' experiences will be explored with a generic 12-item questionnaire, developed for use in outpatient clinics, prior to and 12 months after bariatric surgery. We will conduct focus-group interviews with patients and healthcare professionals to explore their experiences when PRO/CFS is integrated into the consultations. Ethics and dissemination Written informed consent will be obtained for all participants in the study. The project is approved by the Norwegian Centre for Research Data, Department of Data Protection Services (ref. no. 282738). The project has also undergone Data Protection Impact Assessments, both at Førde Hospital Trust and at St. Olav Hospital (registration no. 2016/3912). Data from the qualitative and quantitative studies will be kept in de-identified form in a secured research database, and the findings will be published in international peer-reviewed journals and presented at scientific conferences. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

AB  - Background.Smart buildings are gaining more awareness and becoming adaptive to building occupant preferences, enabling by personal data processing given the implementation of sensors and pervasive computing. Although these technologies may provide great benefits, they can equally threaten the privacy of building occupants and raise data security concerns.Aim. The complexity of smart buildings poses difficulties when applying the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) in addressing the aforementioned concerns. This paper unpacks the specific ambiguities that make applying the GDPR in this context challenging and identify the key requirements for data controllers in managing data privacy. Methods. This paper takes on a doctrinal approach to research by drawing upon legal sources and existing scholarship in related fields, in particular, legal privacy scholars. Results. The pressing compliance problems stem from the debate on what is considered as 'personal data' in smart buildings in which dictates the compliance requirements, in particular, data protection impact assessments (DPIAs). We identify three facets that smart building controllers should focus on in complying with the GDPR: establishing personal data, identifying individual rights, and determining a high risk to the rights and freedom of natural persons. Conclusions. The law can help prevent harms and ensure that individual rights are protected in smart buildings. To achieve this, understanding the compliance pain points of smart environment in order to strike the balance between the privacy of the occupants and the benefits of smart buildings is crucial. This is a call for further empirical and interdisciplinary research to effectively address the issues surrounding smart environment compliance challenges.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Smart devices have become ubiquitous in everyday life, and it is commonplace that migrants are among the users of connected tools. With the realization that migrants rely on connectivity for multiple purposes, including to access information and services, many initiatives started working on developing ICT tools to assist migrants to integrate into their new society. Technological tools, however, come with inherent risks, many of which are linked to the processing of personal data of their users. This is especially true for migrants, who are often vulnerable due to their migration status, which is not always secure in the host country. To mitigate these risks, we argue that an expanded data protection impact assessment, analyzing not only the impacts related to data protection, but also to the specific situation of migrants, should be conducted at the outset of any technology development project to influence the development of safe and reliable ICT tools for this target population. A practical example of the application of such an assessment is provided, based on the authors’ experience as legal advisors in the REBUILD project, which is one of the current initiatives in the EU aiming to develop ICT tools for migrant integration. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Modern cars are getting so computerised that ENISA's phrase 'smart cars' is a perfect fit. The amount of personal data that they process is very large and, yet, increasing. Hence, the need to address citizens' privacy while they drive and, correspondingly, the importance of privacy threat modelling (in support of a respective risk assessment, such as through a Data Protection Impact Assessment). This paper addresses privacy threats by advancing a general modelling methodology and by demonstrating it specifically on soft privacy, which ensures citizens' full control on their personal data. By considering all relevant threat agents, the paper applies the methodology to the specific automotive domain while keeping threats at the same level of detail as ENISA's. The main result beside the modelling methodology consists of both domain-independent and automotive domain-dependent soft privacy threats. While cybersecurity has been vastly threat-modelled so far, this paper extends the literature with a threat model for soft privacy on smart cars, producing 17 domain-independent threats that, associated with 41 domain-specific assets, shape a novel set of domain-dependent threats in automotive.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - As modern web browsers gain new and increasingly powerful features the importance of impact assessments of the new functionality becomes crucial.A web privacy impact assessment of a planned web browser feature, the Ambient Light Sensor API, indicated risks arising from the exposure of overly precise information about the lighting conditions in the user environment. The analysis led to the demonstration of direct risks of leaks of user data, such as the list of visited websites or exfiltration of sensitive content across distinct browser contexts. Our work contributed to the creation of web standards leading to decisions by browser vendors (i.e. obsolescence, non-implementation or modification to the operation of browser features). We highlight the need to consider broad risks when making reviews of new features. We offer practically-driven high-level observations lying on the intersection of web security and privacy risk engineering and modeling, and standardization. We structure our work as a case study from activities spanning over three years. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Introduction Traumatic injuries constitute a major cause of mortality and morbidity. Still, the public health burden of trauma in Norway has not been characterised using nationwide registry data. More knowledge is warranted on trauma risk factors and the long-term outcomes following trauma. The Injury Prevention and long-term Outcomes following Trauma project will establish a comprehensive research database. The Norwegian National Trauma Registry (NTR) will be merged with several data sources to pursue the following three main research topics: (1) the public health burden of trauma to society (eg, excess mortality and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs)), (2) trauma aetiology (eg, socioeconomic factors, comorbidity and drug use) and (3) trauma survivorship (eg, survival, drug use, use of welfare benefits, work ability, education and income). Methods and analysis The NTR (n≈27 000 trauma patients, 2015-2018) will be coupled with the data from Statistics Norway, the Norwegian Patient Registry, the Cause of Death Registry, the Registry of Primary Health Care and the Norwegian Prescription Database. To quantify the public health burden, DALYs will be calculated from the NTR. To address trauma aetiology, we will conduct nested case-control studies with 10 trauma-free controls (drawn from the National Population Register) matched to each trauma case on birth year, sex and index date. Conditional logistic regression models will be used to estimate trauma risk according to relevant exposures. To address trauma survivorship, we will use cohort and matched cohort designs and time-to-event analyses to examine various post-trauma outcomes. Ethics and dissemination The project is approved by the Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics. The project's data protection impact assessment is approved by the data protection officer. Results will be disseminated to patients, in peer-reviewed journals, at conferences and in the media. © 2021 BMJ Publishing Group. All rights reserved.

AB  - Maritime surveillance is essential for creating maritime awareness and saving lives. With new technologies, privacy and ethics in surveillance will be of special concern. On the other hand, processing of personal data in surveillance is regulated by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and/or by the ‘Police-Justice Directive’ 2016/680. GDPR encourages applying a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) to identify and minimize data protection risks as the initial step of any new project. This design science research (DSR) shows how DPIA is adapted in the MARISA project and tries to be a step towards new meta-artifacts and useful methods for the design and validation of privacy requirements engineering approaches into maritime surveillance ICT systems. This DSR also highlights the importance of DSR cycles in designing new artifacts and processes for building these artefacts. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

AB  - Discussion about vulnerable individuals and communities spread from research ethics to consumer law and human rights. According to many theoreticians and practitioners, the framework of vulnerability allows formulating an alternative language to articulate problems of inequality, power imbalances and social injustice. Building on this conceptualisation, we try to understand the role and potentiality of the notion of vulnerable data subjects. The starting point for this reflection is wide-ranging development, deployment and use of data-driven technologies that may pose substantial risks to human rights, the rule of law and social justice. Implementation of such technologies can lead to discrimination systematic marginalisation of different communities and the exploitation of people in particularly sensitive life situations. Considering those problems, we recognise the special role of personal data protection and call for its vulnerability-aware interpretation. This article makes three contributions. First, we examine how the notion of vulnerability is conceptualised and used in the philosophy, human rights and European law. We then confront those findings with the presence and interpretation of vulnerability in data protection law and discourse. Second, we identify two problematic dichotomies that emerge from the theoretical and practical application of this concept in data protection. Those dichotomies reflect the tensions within the definition and manifestation of vulnerability. To overcome limitations that arose from those two dichotomies we support the idea of layered vulnerability, which seems compatible with the GDPR and the risk-based approach. Finally, we outline how the notion of vulnerability can influence the interpretation of particular provisions in the GDPR. In this process, we focus on issues of consent, Data Protection Impact Assessment, the role of Data Protection Authorities, and the participation of data subjects in the decision making about data processing. © 2020

AB  - The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) imposes different requirements for data controllers collecting personal data to protect individuals’ privacy. This fact triggered many studies and projects to investigate Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) for the fulfillment of the compliance requirements. In this paper, after reviewing some of the current challenges and gaps in GDPR compliance, we argue the use of Semantic Technologies in PETs in the form of an Intelligent Compliance Agent (ICA) to support data controllers in carrying out a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA). Models and ontologies representing entities involved in the DPIA process can help data controllers determine the risk of their processing activities. Additionally, an inference engine, equipped with a knowledge base of DPIA-related obligations, can effectively assist data controllers in taking specific actions when a legal fact is triggered based on met conditions. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The process of digitalization of societies and innovation is involving the fast introduction of new technologies in different sectors. However, the development of technology represents a challenge as it involves technical, legal, economic and social aspects that have to be considered since its conception or design. The aim of this paper is to offer an adaptation of an existing legal methodology, the Data Protection Impact Assessment, as a legal obligation to evaluate technological proposals and assure compliance with privacy by design requirements. For that purpose, we will refer to the specific case of Identity Management technologies. We introduce the main challenges in the sector of Digital Identity Management as well as the importance of covering the "architecture"and "user"sides in the development of safer technologies by citing concrete examples. Finally, in order to provide a more practical view of the methodology to adapt the Data Protection Impact Assessment, we refer to the work developed in the research project OLYMPUS in the evaluation of its privacy implications. By introducing this example, the paper offers a specific methodology directly reusable for the study of technological proposals in IdM but that can be adapted to any other sector. © 2021 ACM.

AB  - As geographers, we often work with personal data, meaning that the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) can have a major impact upon our research. The GDPR is a set of legal requirements that serves to ensure the protection of personal data. In this paper, we reflect on our experiences of how the GDPR impacts upon the planning and conduct of (international) geographical research; and develop good data protection practices for geography. In so doing, we explore the Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) as a method to explore data protection and privacy issues and discuss three relevant issues for geographers in relation to the GDPR: (1) informing research participants; (2) data management; and (3) international collaboration. Although it is time-consuming to make a project ‘GDPR proof’, the process helps researchers to thoroughly think through its privacy implications at an early stage. Thus, the GDPR does not make geographical research impossible, but rather contributes to making it more effective and fairer. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to assist organizations to protect the privacy of their users and the security of the data that they store and process. Users may be the customers of the organization (people using the offered services) or the employees (users who operate the systems of the organization). To be more specific, this paper proposes a privacy impact assessment (PIA) method that explicitly takes into account the organizational characteristics and employs a list of well-defined metrics as input, demonstrating its applicability to two hospital information systems with different characteristics. Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents a PIA method that employs metrics and takes into account the peculiarities and other characteristics of the organization. The applicability of the method has been demonstrated on two Hospital Information Systems with different characteristics. The aim is to assist the organizations to estimate the criticality of potential privacy breaches and, thus, to select the appropriate security measures for the protection of the data that they collect, process and store. Findings: The results of the proposed PIA method highlight the criticality of each privacy principle for every data set maintained by the organization. The method employed for the calculation of the criticality level, takes into account the consequences that the organization may experience in case of a security or privacy violation incident on a specific data set, the weighting of each privacy principle and the unique characteristics of each organization. So, the results of the proposed PIA method offer a strong indication of the security measures and privacy enforcement mechanisms that the organization should adopt to effectively protect its data. Originality/value: The novelty of the method is that it handles security and privacy requirements simultaneously, as it uses the results of risk analysis together with those of a PIA. A further novelty of the method is that it introduces metrics for the quantification of the requirements and also that it takes into account the specific characteristics of the organization. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Introduction In Europe, alcohol consumption is responsible for many diseases, disabilities, injuries and premature deaths. In France, alcohol consumption represents an important health burden, due to its frequency, scale and the serious damage it causes. One of the keys to addressing the problem would appear to be the adoption of harm and risk reduction approaches. In order to operationalise this strategy, the Nouvelle Aquitaine Regional Health Agency is funding three different programmes to reduce the harm and risks associated with alcohol consumption: Alcochoix, Iaca and ETP (Education Thérapeutique du Patient) Conso-repère. We are interested in understanding how, under what circumstances, through which mechanisms and for which population the different programmes work. Methods and analysis The ECIAE study (a cross-evaluation of the 3 programs Iaca/Alcochoix/ ETP (Patient Therapeutic Education) is a theory-based evaluation where the realist evaluation method is used to explore effects, intervention mechanisms and the influence of context on outcomes. This realist evaluation is based on multiple case studies in two nested levels. At the first level, each centre implementing the programme will represent a case. At the second level, each programme will represent a case in which a set of activities is conducted to achieve risk reduction objectives. Ethics and dissemination The project will be carried out in full compliance with existing legislation and international conventions. It was subject to analysis, including a privacy impact assessment conducted by the Data Protection Officer of the University of Bordeaux. The University of Bordeaux has ensured that all the regulatory procedures related to the ECIAE study have been carried out. The dissemination plan includes scientific papers, seminars, a report and recommendation and a public restitution. The study will provide evidence-based results to help health authorities roll out strategies to reduce risks and harm associated with alcohol use.  ©

AB  - The presence of experts, such as a data protection officer (DPO) and a privacy engineer is essential in Privacy Requirements Engineering. This task is carried out in various forms including threat modeling and privacy impact assessment. The knowledge required for performing privacy threat modeling can be a serious challenge for a novice privacy engineer. We aim to bridge this gap by developing an automated approach via machine learning that is able to detect privacy-related entities in the user stories. The relevant entities include (1) the Data Subject, (2) the Processing, and (3) the Personal Data entities. We use a state-of-the-art Named Entity Recognition (NER) model along with contextual embedding techniques. We argue that an automated approach can assist agile teams in performing privacy requirements engineering techniques such as threat modeling, which requires a holistic understanding of how personally identifiable information is used in a system. In comparison to other domain-specific NER models, our approach achieves a reasonably good performance in terms of precision and recall.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Technological advancements allow biometric applications to be more omnipresent than in any other time before. This paper argues that in the current EU data protection regulation, classification applications using biometric data receive less protection compared to biometric recognition. We analyse preconditions in the regulatory language and explore how this has the potential to be the source of unique privacy risks for processing operations classifying individuals based on soft traits like emotions. This can have high impact on personal freedoms and human rights and, therefore, should be subject to data protection impact assessment. © 2021 Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI). All rights reserved.

AB  - Many employers now use complex algorithms to assess job applications. These algorithms can have discriminatory effects for women, ethnic minorities, people with disabilities and other legally protected groups. This article evaluates the application of UK law to the use of such algorithms, and finds that equality and data protection laws seek to balance the harms of these tools against the benefits of their use. The article then considers the application of these laws in practice, and finds that the opacity of automated hiring poses a significant challenge to enforcement. The article suggests that a 'transparent recruitment scheme' should therefore be introduced, which would incentivise the publication of equality metrics contained in employers' data protection impact assessments. This scheme should be a collaborative effort between the Information Commissioner's Office and the Equality and Human Rights Commission.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Privacy has become an increasingly significant apprehension in today's rapidly changing economy primarily for personal and sensitive user data. The levels of personal data violation are increasing day by day however privacy-preserving frameworks are available. This paper conducted an in-depth analysis of contemporary frameworks to identify the key mechanisms to produce a sophisticated data privacy framework to reduce the rate of data breach particularly for the Patient Record Management System (PRMS). There are several studies available that stated healthcare data privacy, still, complete data protection solution with the application of privacy by design towards patients' health data by ensuring privacy in each layer of the PRMS are quite limited, which is the focus of this study. PRMS manages personal and sensitive data while delivering healthcare services to the patients and as such, have also the potential to carry significant risks to the privacy of their data. A novel conceptual framework with three distinct and sequential phases is suggested in this research, each of which is defined in a distinct section. The first phase is defined as the planning to identify the key limitations of contemporary frameworks so these can be minimized to ensure privacy in each layer of data processing. The second phase incorporates the key components of data privacy to satisfy the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed framework. Finally, the third phase is the implementation of the selected requirements of the assessment phase to prevent privacy incursion events in PRMS. The complete framework is anticipated to deliver a sophisticated resistance in contradiction to the continuous data breaches in the patients' information domain.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The introduction of the Payment Service Directive (PSD2) has accelerated financial services and open banking growth. Deploying appropriate identity management solutions is crucial. This implies the adoption of secure protocols for authentication and authorization, such as OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0. The PSD2 also requires the application of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) when transactions involve personal data. In turn, the GDPR mandates a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) for assessing risks posed to data subjects’ rights and freedom. This is a time-consuming and challenging task requiring heterogeneous skills that include the knowledge of best practices for deploying protocols, security mechanisms adopted by available identity management providers, and the capability to perform careful what-if analysis of the possible alternatives. To assist users in this task, we propose a methodology based on the formalization of the what-if analysis as an optimization problem that available tools can solve. The formalization is derived from the OAuth 2.0 and OpenID connects standards, security best practices to mitigate threats, and thorough the evaluation of 19 identity management providers to check their supported features concerning the identified set of features for OAuth/OIDC solutions. We apply the methodology to assist controllers and identify the most appropriate security setup to drive the process of making financial services compliant with the PSD2. © 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.

AB  - The General Data Protection Regulation is the core instrument of the reformed legal framework for personal data protection in the European Union. The GDPR was put into effect on May 25, 2018, and requires assessing and conducting a Data Protection Impact Assessment for processing operations that are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, specifically using new technologies and considering the nature, scope, context, and purposes of the processing. Although GDPR does not precisely specify the types of processing activities for which a DPIA would be necessary, through the guidelines that it provides, the organization should conduct a DPIA, if there is large scale processing of health data. An example of this, is a Cloud-based Health Organization. Taking into account this parameter, that Cloud-based Health Organization processes personal data that could impact the freedoms and rights of a data subject under the GDPR and that the GDPR does not specify a DPIA process to follow, instead it allows organizations to use a framework that complements their existing processes, this paper presents the last two steps of a DPIA study for a Cloud-based Health Organization and provides guidelines on how to carry them out effectively. This study is part of a project for the compliance of Cloud-based Health Organizations with the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679. For fulfilling the objectives of this study, the PIA-CNIL methodology is applied, which is in accordance with the data privacy impact assessment that has been described in ISO/IEC 29134. The main contribution of this work is the development of a guide that is designed to help Cloud-based Health organizations identify, analyze and reduce data protection risks in relation to their processing activities. More analytically, this research presents the risks that could be materialized by the data processing activities carried out by a Cloud-based Health Organization regarding its Processing Activities and could have an impact on the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons. © 2023 Curran Associates Inc..

AB  - Although decoding the content of mental states is currently unachievable, technologies such as neural interfaces, affective computing systems, and digital behavioral technologies enable increasingly reliable statistical associations between certain data patterns and mental activities such as memories, intentions, and emotions. Furthermore, Artificial Intelligence enables the exploration of these activities not just retrospectively but also in a real-time and predictive manner. In this article, we introduce the notion of 'mental data', defined as any data that can be organized and processed to make inferences about the mental states of a person, including their cognitive, affective and conative states. Further, we analyze existing legal protections for mental data by considering the lawfulness of their processing in light of different legal bases and purposes, with special focus on the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We argue that the GDPR is an adequate tool to mitigate risks related to mental data processing. However, we recommend that interpreters focus on processing characteristics, rather than merely on the category of data at issue. Finally, we call for a 'Mental Data Protection Impact Assessment', a specific data protection impact assessment designed to better assess and mitigate the risks to fundamental rights and freedoms associated with the processing of mental data.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - As the upsurge of information and communication technologies has become the foundation of all modern application domains, fueled by the unprecedented amount of data being processed and exchanged, besides security concerns, there are also pressing privacy considerations that come into play. Compounding this issue, there is currently a documented gap between the cybersecurity and privacy risk assessment (RA) avenues, which are treated as distinct management processes and capitalise on rather rigid and make-like approaches. In this paper, we aim to combine the best of both worlds by proposing the APSIA (Automated Privacy and Security Impact Assessment) methodology, which stands for Automated Privacy and Security Impact Assessment. APSIA is powered by the use of interdependency graph models and data processing flows used to create a digital reflection of the cyber-physical environment of an organisation. Along with this model, we present a novel and extensible privacy risk scoring system for quantifying the privacy impact triggered by the identified vulnerabilities of the ICT infrastructure of an organisation. We provide a prototype implementation and demonstrate its applicability and efficacy through a specific case study in the context of a heavily regulated sector (i.e., assistive healthcare domain) where strict security and privacy considerations are not only expected but mandated so as to better showcase the beneficial characteristics of APSIA. Our approach can complement any existing security-based RA tool and provide the means to conduct an enhanced, dynamic and generic assessment as an integral part of an iterative and unified risk assessment process on-the-fly. Based on our findings, we posit open issues and challenges, and discuss possible ways to address them, so that such holistic security and privacy mechanisms can reach their full potential towards solving this conundrum. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are vulnerable to security gaps that can result in serious consequences, including cyber-physical and privacy risks. For example, an attacker can reconstruct a vehicle's location trajectory by knowing the speed and steering wheel position of the vehicle. Such inferences not only lead to safety issues but also significantly threaten privacy. This paper assesses the privacy impacts of cyber threats on vehicular networks. We augment the Privacy Risk Assessment Methodology (PRAM), proposed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, with cyber threats, with cyber threats, which are, in practice, mapped to PRAM impact metrics. We demonstrate the practical application of the enhanced PRAM methodology through a use case that highlights attacks leading to privacy risks in CAVs. The consideration of cyber attacks for privacy risk assessment addresses a major gap in current practices, which is to integrate privacy risk into cyber risk management. © 2023 ACM.

AB  - Identification and authentication (IA) are security procedures that are ubiquitous in our online life, and that constantly require disclosing personal, sensitive information to non-fully trusted service providers, or to fully trusted providers that unintentionally may fail to protect such information. Although user IA processes are extensively supported by heterogeneous software and hardware, the simultaneous protection of user privacy is an open problem. From a legal point of view, the European Union legislation requires protecting the processing of personal data and evaluating its impact on privacy throughout the whole IA procedure. Privacy Threat Analysis (PTA) is one of the pillars for the required Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA). amongst the few existing approaches for conducting a PTA, LINDDUN is a very promising framework, although generic, in the sense that it has not been specifically conceived for IA. In this work, we investigate an extension of LINDDUN that allows performing a reliable and systematically-reproducible PTA of user IA processes, thereby contributing to one of the cornerstones of PIA. Specifically, we propose a high-level description of the IA verification process, which we illustrate with an UML use case. Then, we design an identification and authentication modelling framework, propose an extension of two critical steps of the LINDDUN scheme, and adapt and tailor the trust boundary concept applied in the original framework. Finally, we propose a systematic methodology aimed to help auditors apply the proposed improvements to the LINDDUN framework. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The importance of privacy by design has increased with initiatives such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). While static, design-level assessment of privacy aspects provides considerable benefits in the creation of privacy-preserving software-intensive systems, operational aspects that are difficult to predict at design-time also play a key role. This is particularly true in the instance of privacy impact or privacy risk: while existing approaches succeed fairly well in assessing the overall risk from a static design context, they are not well suited to capture risk elements that are dynamic and often impossible to foresee. In this position paper, we highlight this problem at the basis of a number of realistic motivational scenarios and outline our vision towards continuous privacy impact assessment and risk management. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - The European (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is applicable since May 2018 and has since posed major challenges for small businesses with limited knowledge and resources. According to Art. 35 of the GDPR, a so-called ‘Data Protection Impact Assessment’ (DPIA) is mandatory if a processing of personal data is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. There is a demand for low-threshold, practical instruments that support the required DPIA. The objective of this research was to develop a new DPIA instrument that meets the needs – as unit of analysis – of non-technology small businesses and complies with the requirements of the EU GDPR. Design Science Research was used as the methodological framework and identified personas were drivers in the development. The result is two variants of instruments that have been carefully evaluated and proven to be valuable. © 2023, EasyChair. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biometric data privacy is becoming a major concern for many organizations in the age of big data, particularly in the ICT sector, because it may be easily exploited in apps. Most apps utilize biometrics by accessing common application programming interfaces (APIs); hence, we aim to categorize their usage. The categorization based on behavior may be closely correlated with the sensitive processing of a user's biometric data, hence highlighting crucial biometric data privacy assessment concerns. We propose PABAU, Privacy Analysis of Biometric API Usage. PABAU learns semantic features of methods in biometric APIs and uses them to detect and categorize the usage of biometric API implementation in the software according to their privacy-related behaviors. This technique bridges the communication and background knowledge gap between technical and non-technical individuals in organizations by providing an automated method for both parties to acquire a rapid understanding of the essential behaviors of biometric API in apps, as well as future support to data protection officers (DPO) with legal documentation, such as conducting a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA). © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Although the Protection of Personal Information Act 4 of 2013 (POPIA) wholeheartedly adopts the command-and-control features of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), POPIA does not include many of the collaborative governance mechanisms in the GDPR. POPIA dilutes the accountability requirements in the GDPR. It rarely requires responsible parties to generate or keep documentation and there is no equivalent of European Data Protection Impact Assessments in the South African Act. This affects the regulation of automated processing that involves profiling. The European system of certifications is also not included in POPIA. POPIA includes a system of codes of conduct but even they have a more peremptory nature. The absence of collaborative governance mechanisms in POPIA constitutes a missed opportunity to build a culture of enhanced data protection in South Africa. The Information Regulator has the task of giving many exemptions and prior approvals under the Act. The newly constituted Information Regulator will find itself exposed as it faces a particularly difficult mandate. © 2022, North-West Unversity. All rights reserved.

AB  - There may be no other fundamental right of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights (ECFR) that raises more questions on the precise object and concept of protection than the right to data protection in Article 8 ECFR. A prominent example is the principle of purpose limitation. The preceding first part of this three-parted series has shown how this ambiguity creates various problems both on the conceptual level of fundamental rights as well as on the level of ordinary law (esp. the GDPR). However, it has also been shown how a re-connection of data protection law to concepts of risk regulation may help clarify these ambiguities. On this basis, the second part of this series demonstrates in detail why data protection laws apply a risk-based approach and why this protection strategy is more effective than a harmbased approach. Further, it is possible to assess whether data protection laws apply certain concepts of the precautionary principle and/or the risk-based approach (in the Anglo-Saxon meaning), and if both, which elements of the law may belong to which strategy. The concept proposed in this chapter will promote, focusing on the principle of purpose limitation, a combination of both strategies leading not only to more effective but also more proportionate protection. The last chapter of this second part will demonstrate why all this makes the fundamental right to data protection in Article 8 ECFR indispensable with respect to the other fundamental rights. © 2021, Lexxion Verlagsgesellschaft mbH.

AB  - Virtual personal assistants (VPAs) are increasingly becoming a common aspect of everyday living. However, with female names, voices and characters, these devices appear to reproduce harmful gender stereotypes about the role of women in society and the type of work women perform. Designed to ‘assist’, VPAs - such as Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa - reproduce and reify the idea that women are subordinate to men, and exist to be ‘used’ by men. Despite their ubiquity, these aspects of their design have seen little critical attention in scholarship, and the potential legal responses to this issue have yet to be fully canvassed. Accordingly, this article sets out to critique the reproduction of negative gender stereotypes in VPAs and explores the provisions and findings within international women’s rights law to assess both how this constitutes indirect discrimination and possible means for redress. In this regard, this article explores the obligation to protect women from discrimination at the hands of private actors under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, and the work of the Committee on Discrimination Against Women on gender stereotyping. With regard to corporate human rights responsibilities, the role of the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights is examined, as well as domestic enforcement mechanisms for international human rights norms and standards, noting the limitations to date in enforcing human rights compliance by multinational private actors. © 2019 The Author.

AB  - Forensic scientists around the world are adopting new technology platforms capable of efficiently analysing a larger proportion of the human genome. Undertaking this analysis could provide significant operational benefits, particularly in giving investigators more information about the donor of genetic material, a particularly useful investigative lead. Such information could include predicting externally visible characteristics such as eye and hair colour, as well as biogeographical ancestry. This article looks at the adoption of this new technology from a privacy perspective, using this to inform and critique the application of a Privacy Impact Assessment to this emerging technology. Noting the benefits and limitations, the article develops a number of themes that would influence a model Privacy Impact Assessment as a contextual framework for forensic laboratories and law enforcement agencies considering implementing forensic DNA phenotyping for operational use. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) seamlessly integrate physical objects with technology, thereby blurring the boundaries between the physical and virtual environments. While this brings many opportunities for progress, it also adds a new layer of complexity to the risk assessment process when attempting to ascertain what privacy risks this might impose on an organisation. In addition, privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), mandate assessment of privacy risks, including making Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) compulsory. We present the DPIA Data Wheel, a holistic privacy risk assessment framework based on Contextual Integrity (CI), that practitioners can use to inform decision making around the privacy risks of CPS. This framework facilitates comprehensive contextual inquiry into privacy risk, that accounts for both the elicitation of privacy risks, and the identification of appropriate mitigation strategies. Further, by using this DPIA framework we also provide organisations with a means of assessing privacy from both the perspective of the organisation and the individual, thereby facilitating GDPR compliance. We empirically evaluate this framework in three different real-world settings. In doing so, we demonstrate how CI can be incorporated into the privacy risk decision-making process in a usable, practical manner that will aid decision makers in making informed privacy decisions. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - In the upcoming General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), privacy by design and privacy impact assessments are given an even more prominent role than before. It is now required that companies build privacy into the core of their technical products. Recently, researchers and industry players have proposed employing threat modeling methods, traditionally used in security engineering, as a way to bridge these two GDPR requirements in the process of engineering systems. Threat modeling, however, typically assumes a waterfall process and monolithic design, assumptions that are disrupted with the popularization of Agile methodologies and Service Oriented Architectures. Moreover, agile service environments make it easier to address some privacy problems, while complicating others. To date, the challenges of applying threat modeling for privacy in agile service environments remain understudied. This paper sets out to expose and analyze this gap. Specifically, we analyze what challenges and opportunities the shifts in software engineering practice introduce into traditional Threat Modeling activities; how they relate to the different Privacy Goals; and what Agile principles and Service properties have an impact on them. Our results show that both agile and services make the end-toend analysis of applications more difficult. At the same time, the former allows for more efficient communications and iterative progress, while the latter enables the parallelization of tasks and the documentation of some architecture decisions. Additionally, we open a new research avenue pointing to Amazon Macie as an example of Machine Learning applications that aim to provide a solution to the scalability and usability of Privacy Threat Modeling processes. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - With female names, voices and characters, artificially intelligent Virtual Personal Assistants such as Alexa, Cortana, and Siri appear to be decisively gendered female. Through an exploration of the various facets of gendering at play in the design of Siri, Alexa and Cortana, we argue that this gendering of VPAs as female may pose a societal harm, insofar as they reproduce normative assumptions about the role of women as submissive and secondary to men. In response, this article turns to examine the potential role and scope of data protection law as one possible solution to this problem. In particular, we examine the role of data privacy impact assessments that highlight the need to go beyond the data privacy paradigm, and require data controllers to consider and address the social impact of their products. © 2019 Nóra Ni Loideain

AB  - The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will become a legal requirement for all organizations in Europe from 25th May 2018 which collect and process data. One of the major changes detailed in Article 22 of the GDPR includes the rights of an individual not to be subject to automated decisionmaking, which includes profiling, unless explicit consent is given. Individuals who are subject to such decision-making have the right to ask for an explanation on how the decision is reached and organizations must utilize appropriate mathematics and statistical procedures. All data collected, including research projects require a privacy by design approach as well as the data controller to complete a Data Protection Impact Assessment in addition to gaining ethical approval. This paper discusses the impact of the GDPR on research projects which contain elements of computational intelligence undertaken within a University or with an Academic Partner. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - The so-called ‘risk-based approach’ introduced by the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is based on the concept that the privacy measures implemented by the data controllers shall be proportional to the level of risks associated with the type of data-processing activities, the evaluation of which should be subject to an objective assessment (the privacy impact assessment; PIA). To guarantee harmonisation among data protection procedures and enforcement across the EU member states, it is crucial for EU data protection supervisory authorities to cooperate in the identification of criteria for the performance of PIAs, possibly taking advantage of the examples in certain EU jurisdictions (such as the UK and France) and the International Standards Organisation (ISO). © Henry Stewart Publications.

AB  - Privacy issues concerning biometric identification are becoming increasingly relevant due to their proliferation in various fields, including identity and access control management (IAM). The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires the implementation of a data protection impact assessment for privacy critical systems. In this paper, we analyse the usefulness of two different privacy impact assessment frameworks in the context of biometric data protection. We use experiences from the SWAN project that processes four different biometric characteristics for authentication purposes. The results of this comparison elucidate how useful these frameworks are in identifying sector-specific privacy risks related to IAM and biometric identification. © 2020 Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI).

AB  - Data protection by design (DPbD), a holistic approach to embedding principles in technical and organizational measures undertaken by data controllers, building on the notion of Privacy by Design, is now a qualified duty in the GDPR. Practitioners have seen DPbD less holistically, instead framing it through the confidentiality-focussed lens of privacy enhancing technologies (PETs). We show that some confidentiality-focussed DPbD strategies used by large data controllers leave data reidentifiable by capable adversaries while heavily limiting controllers' ability to provide data subject rights, such as access, erasure and objection, to manage this risk. Informed by case studies of Apple's Siri voice assistant and Transport for London's Wi-Fi analytics, we suggest three main ways to make deployed DPbD more accountable and data subject-centric: building parallel systems to fulfil rights, including dealing with volunteered data; making inevitable trade-offs more explicit and transparent through Data Protection Impact Assessments; and through ex ante and ex post information rights (Articles 13-15), which we argue may require the provision of information concerning DPbD trade-offs. Despite steep technical hurdles, we call both for researchers in PETs to develop rigorous techniques to balance privacy-as-control with privacy-as-confidentiality, and for DPAs to consider tailoring guidance and future frameworks to better oversee the trade-offs being made by primarily well-intentioned data controllers employing DPbD. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - With the recent introduction of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), privacy impact assessments (PIA) have become mandatory in many cases. To support organisations in correctly implementing those, researchers and practitioners have provided reference processes and tooling. Integrating automation features into PIA tools can streamline the implementation of compliant privacy impact assessments in organizations. Based on a general reference architecture and reference process based on guidance by authorities, this contribution offers a systematic analysis of which process steps show the most promise with regard to this, and discusses impediments to this approach and directions for future research. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - The goal of this contribution is to understand the notion of risk as it is enshrined in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), with a particular on Art. 35 providing for the obligation to carry out data protection impact assessments (DPIAs), the first risk management tool to be enshrined in EU data protection law, and which therefore contains a number of key elements in order to grasp the notion. The adoption of this risk-based approach has not come without a number of debates and controversies, notably on the scope and meaning of the risk-based approach. Yet, what has remained up to date out of the debate is the very notion of risk itself, which underpins the whole risk-based approach. The contribution uses the notions of risk and risk analysis as tools for describing and understanding risk in the GDPR. One of the main findings is that the GDPR risk is about “compliance risk” (i.e., the lower the compliance the higher the consequences upon the data subjects’ rights). This stance is in direct contradiction with a number of positions arguing for a strict separation between compliance and risk issues. This contribution sees instead issues of compliance and risk to the data subjects rights and freedoms as deeply interconnected. The conclusion will use these discussions as a basis to address the long-standing debate on the differences between privacy impact assessments (PIAs) and DPIAs. They will also warn against the fact that ultimately the way risk is defined in the GDPR is somewhat irrelevant: what matters most is the methodology used and the type of risk at work therein. © 2018 Raphaël Gellert

AB  - In order to combat cyber-attacks, an organisation can decide to train its employees. Improving cyber-skills of employees through educational games means their personal data will be processed and therefore it falls under the scope of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The goal of this paper is to address challenges that organisations are likely to face in practice, such as invalidity of employees' consent and over-intrusive monitoring. It argues that in order to approach training lawfully, organisations should (1) choose their external trainer with due diligence, (2) carry out a data protection impact assessment, and under certain circumstances (3) appoint a data protection officer. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - The IoT is innovative and important phenomenon prone to several services and applications such as the blockchain, but it should consider the legal issues related to the data protection law. We should be taken into account the legal issues related to the data protection and privacy law. Technological solutions are welcome, but it is necessary, before developing applications, to consider the risks which we cannot dismiss. Personal data is a value. It is important to evaluate the European Regulation n. 679/2016, European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that will enter into force on 25 May 2018. The GDPR introduces Data Protection by Design and by Default, Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), data breach notification and significant administrative fines in respect of infringements of the Regulation. It is fundamental to evaluate the legal issues and prevent them, adopting in each project the Data Protection by Design approach. Regarding the data protection and security risks, there are some issues with potential consequences for data and liability. A correct law analysis allows evaluating risks preventing the wrong use of personal data. The contribution describes the main legal issues related to privacy and data protection focusing on the Privacy by Design approach, according to the GDPR. © 2018 The authors and IOS Press.

AB  - Privacy and security are crosscutting in the design of any software system or service, and thus a broad focus on the end-to-end system architecture is required. For this reason, systematic approaches to elicitate security and privacy threats and risks are gaining importance. Such approaches however are highly analytic, require substantial effort and rely extensively on domain expertise. Applying these methods in practice easily leads to the problem of threat explosion, where the effort required to prioritize and consider all threats starts exceeding the benefits of adopting these methods. To address this impediment to practical adoption, we present our approach to improve LINDDUN, an existing privacy engineering method. We create a domain refinement questionnaire, which involves activating and deactivating threat trees nodes by posing specific questions to the privacy engineer or software architect, leading to the a priori exclusion of non-applicable threats from the analysis exercise. The efficiency gain can be strengthened further by incorporating reusable domain knowledge in the approach to instantiate the questionnaire. © 2018 Authors.

AB  - Privacy risk assessments aim to analyze and quantify the privacy risks associated with new systems. As such, they are critically important in ensuring that adequate privacy protections are built in. However, current methods to quantify privacy risk rely heavily on experienced analysts picking the “correct” risk level on e.g. a five-point scale. In this paper, we argue that a more scientific quantification of privacy risk increases accuracy and reliability and can thus make it easier to build privacy-friendly systems. We discuss how the impact and likelihood of privacy violations can be decomposed and quantified, and stress the importance of meaningful metrics and units of measurement. We suggest a method of quantifying and representing privacy risk that considers a collection of factors as well as a variety of contexts and attacker models. We conclude by identifying some of the major research questions to take this approach further in a variety of application scenarios. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.

AB  - Over the last decades, developments in the fields of genetics and bioinformatics caused a marked increase in the processing of human genetic data by various companies and institutions. This results in the adoption of several international documents and the emergence of legal norms on the protection of genetic data. The paper examines how and to what extent the interests and rights of the data subject with regard to the processing of genetic data are protected in the European Union. It is concluded that under the GDPR this task is implemented through classifying genetic data as sensitive, reliance on anonymisation and pseudonymisation, as well as introduction of the procedure of data protection impact assessment. Nevertheless, given the unique characteristics of genetic data distinguishing them from other categories of personal data, these measures cannot be regarded as sufficient and effective. The paper argues that current EU data protection legislation creates favourable conditions for genetic research, thereby ensuring particular public interests, but does not establish a special regime for genetic data processing appropriate to potential threats in this field and risks to the rights of data subjects. © 2020, Masaryk University Journal of Law and Technology.

AB  - Contemporary data processing activities rarely involve a single entity but, rather, rely on complex inter-organizational collaborations between (joint) controllers, processors, sub-processors, recipients, and third parties. However, current approaches in support of Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) traditionally address data protection risks through the perspective of a single entity. As a result, the assessment of complex, inter-organizational data processing activities is scattered across multiple isolated efforts conducted by different parties. This leads to mismatches between the factual descriptions of data processing activities among the concerned entities, but also dilutes the argumentation related to the general principles governing the processing of personal data. In this article, we explore and discuss the benefits and downsides of approaches that foster inter-organizational collaboration when conducting a DPIA. We also highlight the main requirements, namely: (i) establishing consensus on and consistency in the descriptions of data processing operations and the legal argumentations, (ii) controlling the sharing of information between organizations, (iii) addressing data protection compliance from an end-to-end, holistic perspective and (iv) allowing for dynamism and continuous, flexible re-evaluation. Finally, we discuss and contrast two alternative approaches for inter-organizational and collaborative DPIA: a fully centralized versus a fully federated approach. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - This workshop introduced participants to the process of Data Protection Impact Assessment. This new tool of the GDPR is highly relevant for any processing of personal data, as it helps to structure the process, be aware of data protection issues and the relevant legislation and implement proper safeguards to protect data subjects. For processing operations posing a high risk for data subjects, a DPIA is mandatory from May 2018. The interactive workshop provided a framework for DPIA and guidance on specific questions such as when a high risk is likely to occur or how specific risks can be evaluated, which was assessed by participants in an interactive session with two different scenarios. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2018.

AB  - Privacy impact assessments are the most frequently approach used by organizations to control privacy risks. However, how to automatically check PII data fields in PIA results is a big challenge. Manual verification of PIA results carried out by information security consultants is time consuming, costly and slow. In addition, detecting errors and anomalies in the data as their concentration wavers after a certain period of time. In this paper, we propose a methodology of checking PII data fields that can greatly reduce human errors and improve the quality of PIA reports. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - The use of various forms of big data have revolutionised scientific research. This includes research in the field of genetics in areas ranging from medical research to anthropology. Developments in this area have inter alia been characterised by the ability to sequence genome wide sequences (GWS) cheaply, the ability to share and combine with other forms of complimentary data and ever more powerful processing techniques that have become possible given tremendous increases in computing power. Given that many if not most of these techniques will make use of personal data it is necessary to take into account data protection law. This article looks at challenges for researchers that will be presented by the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, which will be in effect from May 2018. The very nature of research with big data in general and genetic data in particular means that in many instances compliance will be onerous, whilst in others it may even be difficult to envisage how compliance may be possible. Compliance concerns include issues relating to ‘purpose limitation’ ‘data minimisation’ and ‘storage limitation’. Other requirements, including the need to facilitate data subject rights and potentially conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) may provide further complications for researchers. Further critical issues to consider include the choice of legal base: whether to opt for what is often seen as the ‘default option’ (i.e. consent) or to process under the so called ‘scientific research exception’. Each presents its own challenges (including the likely need to gain ethical approval) and opportunities that will have to be considered according to the particular context in question. © 2018 Paul Quinn and Liam Quinn

AB  - According to Article 35 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), data controllers are obligated to conduct a privacy impact assessment (PIA) to ensure the protection of sensitive data. Failure to properly protect sensitive data may affect data subjects negatively, and damage the reputation of data processors. Existing PIA approaches cannot be easily conducted, since they are mainly abstract or imprecise. Moreover, they lack a methodology to conduct the assessment concerning the design of IT systems. We propose a novel methodology to support PIA by performing model-based privacy and security analyses in the early phases of the system development. In our methodology, the design of a system is analyzed and, where necessary, appropriate security and privacy controls are suggested to improve the design. Hence, this methodology facilitates privacy by design as prescribed in Article 25 of the GDPR. We evaluated our methodology based on three industrial case studies and a quality-based comparison to the state of the art. © 2018 ACM.

AB  - In this work we investigate which aspects of data protection regulation must be carefully observed when implementing Blockchain-based projects in smart cities. This technology provides interesting properties and allows governments to develop flexible and innovative data management systems. Nevertheless, realizing the benefits of using Blockchains requires understanding the government processes along with the legal framework and political setting imposed on government. Though it is a buzzword, Blockchain may not always be the best solution for data processing, and carrying out a Data Protection Impact Assessment could allow an analysis of the necessity and proportionality of the mechanism. Furthermore, principles relating to security of data remain applicable to Blockchains. We discuss points of interaction between Blockchain technology and the European Union data protection framework, and provide recommendations on how to better develop Blockchain-based projects in smart cities. The findings of the study should provide public sector actors with a guideline to assess the real necessity and better format of a Blockchain-based application. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - The first broad reform of personal data protection legislation in the European Union entered into force in May 2018 (Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the General Data Protection Regulation). Remarkably, with this reform a risk-based approach has been introduced as the core data protection enforcement model, while data protection authorities see their regulatory role significantly weakened. The risk-based approach is to be implemented by the data controllers (i.e. the operators) via data protection impact assessments (evoking the established environmental impact assessment procedure) and notification of breaches, among other procedures. Hence the scope of both the concepts of risk and risk regulation spread beyond conventional domains, namely the environment, public health or safety, i.e. physical risks, to encompass risks to intangible values, i.e. individual rights and freedoms, presumably harder to assess and manage. Strikingly, the reform has been accompanied by a confident discourse by EU institutions, and their avowed belief in the reform’s ability to safeguard the fundamental right to data protection in the face of evolving data processing techniques, specifically, big data, the Internet of Things, and related algorithmic decision-making. However, one may wonder whether there isn’t cause for concern in view of the way the risk-based approach has been designed in the data protection legislation. In this article, the risk-based approach to data protection is analysed in the light of the reform’s underlying rationality. Comparison with the risk regulatory experience in environmental law, particularly the environmental impact assessment procedure, is drawn upon to assist us in pondering the shortcomings, as well as the opportunities of the novel risk-based approach. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - While the importance of consent request in today's society is increasing, specially online as a lawful basis for the processing of personal data, no detailed analysis of current technological solutions is available. In this work, we describe the existing technological solutions to express online consent in a positive fashion, including all the properties that an online solution should hold. We conclude by offering a risk proposal based on the linear combination of the rating of each one of these properties. We observe a low agreement between observers, highlighting that it is not easy to fulfill the requirements of the GDPR and showing that these studies are important when performing a Data Protection Impact Assessment. To overcome the low agreement, we propose the median of the observers' rate. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) encourages the use of Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) to integrate privacy into organisations' activities and practices from early design onwards. To date, however, there has been little prescription about how Security & Privacy Requirements Engineering processes map to the necessary activities of a DPIA, and how these activities can be tool-supported. To address this problem, we present a tool-supported process for undertaking DPIAs using existing Requirements Engineering approaches and the CAIRIS platform. We illustrate this process using a real-world case study example where it was used to elicit privacy risks for a prototype medical application to support chemotherapy treatment. ©2018 IEEE.

AB  - Since the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) entered into force, every actor involved in the processing of personal data must comply with Data Protection by Design (DPbD). Doing so requires assessing the risks to data subjects' rights and freedoms and implementing appropriate countermeasures. While legal experts traditionally apply Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA), software engineers rely on threat modeling for their assessment. Despite significant differences, both approaches nonetheless revolve around (i) a description of the system and (ii) the identification, assessment and mitigation of specific risks. In practice, however, DPIAs and threat modeling are usually performed in complete isolation, following their own, unharmonized lexicon and abstractions. Such as disconnect lowers the quality of the assessment and of the conceptual and architectural trade-offs In this paper, we present (i) an overview of the legal and architectural modeling requirements and (ii) incentives and recommendations for aligning both modeling paradigms in order to support data protection by design from both a legal and a technical perspective. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Developing ubiquitous computing systems in compliance with the data protection regulation is a difficult task. The European General Data Protection Regulation requests system developers to apply a privacy-by-design methodology and perform privacy impact assessments throughout the whole development life-cycle. Our proposal is a software assisted process framework that facilitates the analysis of privacy implications in ubiquitous computing systems. This software has been evaluated with students and ubicomp experts. © 2020, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.

AB  - Rule of law principles are essential for a fair and just society and apply to government activities regardless of whether those activities are undertaken by a human or automated data processing. This article explores how Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) could provide a mechanism for improved rule of law governance of data processing systems developed and used by government for public purposes in civil and administrative areas. Applying rule of law principles to two case studies provides a sketch of the issues and concerns that this article's proposals for DPIAs seek to address. The article undertakes comparative analysis to find relevant principles and concepts for governance of data processing systems, looking at human rights impact assessments, administrative law, and process rights in environmental law. Drawing on this comparative analysis to identify specific recommendations for DPIAs, the article offers guidance on how DPIAs could be used to strengthen the governance of data processing by government in rule of law terms.  © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - The security threats related to personally identifiable information are increasing dramatically. In addition to government agencies, large international companies are potential victims. To comply with regulations such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, organizations are required to carry out a privacy impact assessment. However, the conventional information security risk assessment model does not provide a clear methodology for conducting privacy impact assessments. In this paper, we propose a privacy-considered information security risk assessment (pISRA) model, which can take both a privacy impact analysis and risk assessment into consideration. Our proposed model can help risk assessors achieve a comparable and reproducible approach for the entire risk assessment process. Additionally, pISRA can assist organizations to select high-risk items for further action. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Further processing is probably one of the lesser researched features of the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). This is remarkable since much of the data to be processed involves data that was collected at an earlier stage and further processing is highly relevant for data controllers. “Further processing” in this article refers to the processing of personal data for a purpose other than that for which it was initially collected. Article 6(4) of the GDPR provides the legal basis for such further processing. The key mechanisms are consent and a compatibility assessment. Many privacy advocates consider consent to be the gold standard for further processing and pay little attention to the compatibility option. Consent, however, puts a significant cognitive load on individuals (the “data subjects”), while it confronts data controllers with serious challenges in obtaining consent and recording its validity. On the other hand, the compatibility assessment allows data controllers to justify the further processing based on the criteria given in Article 6(4), but it might leave individuals powerless. In this article, we compare the two key mechanisms for further processing, consent and compatibility, and we discuss various compensating measures controllers can take to ensure that compatibility-based processing is a real alternative to consent. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.

AB  - The importance of Privacy Ιmpact Αssessment (PIA) has been emphasized by privacy researchers and its conduction is provisioned in legal frameworks, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation. However, it is still a complicated and bewildering task for organizations processing personal data, as available methods and guidelines fail to provide adequate guidance confusing organisations and PIA practitioners. This paper analyzes the interplay among PIA stakeholders and proposes an organizational scheme for successful PIA projects. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to provide practical guidance to ensure compliance of the SHiELD project with the General Data Protection Regulation (EU), 2016/679 also known as “GDPR”. The SHiELD project is a H2020 project whose objective is to support the lawful exchange of clinical information across Europe and is built upon the epSOS project. GDPR remains in the path defined in 1995 and does not change the main elements of the model provided by the Directive. Notice and consent remain an important legal ground for the processing of sensitive data, this is why a two-steps-consent by the data subject to the transfer and processing of health data should be envisaged by the project. However, compared to the Directive 95/46/EC, the GDPR imposes stricter security obligations on data processors and controllers. This new Regulation simultaneously broadens the relevance of the risk - as it is explicitly based on the notion of risk/based approach - and a detailed Data Protection Impact Assessment must be undertaken and documented prior the project is implemented. In line with the new accountability principle, processors and controllers should also be able to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR. This paper, in the conclusions, also underlines that SHiELD project full compliance to the Regulation could be assessed only when all Member States have revised or adapted their legislation in order to comply with the GDPR end to exploit their discretional power, delegated to them by the EU legislator on specific subjects, like processing of genetic, biometric or health data. © 2018 MCCSIS 2018 - Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems; Proceedings of the International Conferences on e-Health 2018, ICT, Society, and Human Beings 2018 and Web Based Communities and Social Media 2018.

AB  - Empirical evidence is mounting that artificial intelligence applications threaten to discriminate against legally protected groups. This raises intricate questions for EU law. The existing categories of EU anti-discrimination law do not provide an easy fit for algorithmic decision making. Furthermore, victims won't be able to prove their case without access to the data and the algorithmic models. Drawing on a growing computer science literature on algorithmic fairness, this article suggests an integrated vision of anti-discrimination and data protection law to enforce fairness in the digital age. It shows how the concepts of anti-discrimination law may be combined with algorithmic audits and data protection impact assessments in an effort to unlock the algorithmic black box. © 2018 Kluwer Law International.

AB  - The content-based publish/subscribe paradigm enables a loosely-coupled and expressive form of communication. However, privacy preservation remains a challenge for distributed event-based middleware especially since encrypted matching incurs significant computing overhead. This paper adapts an existing attribute-based encryption scheme and combines it with data splitting, a non-cryptographic method called for alleviating the cost of encrypted matching. Data splitting enables to form groups of attributes that are sent apart over several independent broker networks so that it prevents the identification of an end-user; and, only identifying attributes are encrypted to prevent data leakage. The goal is to achieve an acceptable privacy level at an affordable computing price by encrypting only the necessary attributes, whose selection is determined through a Privacy Impact Assessment.

AB  - Although the protection of personal data is harmonized within the EU by Directive 95/46/EC and will be further harmonized by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2018, there are significant differences in the ways in which EU member states implemented the protection of privacy and personal data in national laws, policies, and practices. This paper presents the main findings of a research project that compares the protection of privacy and personal data in eight EU member states: France, Germany, the UK, Ireland, Romania, Italy, Sweden, and the Netherlands. The comparison focuses on five major themes: awareness and trust, government policies for personal data protection, the applicable laws and regulations, implementation of those laws and regulations, and supervision and enforcement. The comparison of privacy and data protection regimes across the EU shows some remarkable findings, revealing which countries are frontrunners and which countries are lagging behind on specific aspects. For instance, the roles of and interplay between governments, civil rights organizations, and data protections authorities vary from country to country. Furthermore, with regard to privacy and data protection there are differences in the intensity and scope of political debates, information campaigns, media attention, and public debate. New concepts like privacy impact assessments, privacy by design, data breach notifications and big data are on the agenda in some but not in all countries. Significant differences exist in (the levels of) enforcement by the different data protection authorities, due to different legal competencies, available budgets and personnel, policies, and cultural factors. © 2018 Bart Custers, Francien Dechesne, Alan M.

AB  - The main goal of this book is to provide an understanding of what is commonly referred to as “the risk-based approach to data protection”. An expression that came to the fore during the overhaul process of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)-even though it can also be found in other statutes under different acceptations. At its core it consists in endowing the regulated organisation that process personal data with increased responsibility for complying with data protection mandates. Such increased compliance duties are performed through risk management tools. It addresses this topic from various perspectives. In framing the risk-based approach as the latest model of a series of regulation models, the book provides an analysis of data protection law from the perspective of regulation theory as well as risk and risk management literatures, and their mutual interlinkages. Further, it provides an overview of the policy developments that led to the adoption of such an approach, which it discusses in the light of regulation theory. It also includes various discussions pertaining to the risk-based approach’s scope and meaning, to the way it has been uptaken in statutes including key provisions such as accountability and data protection impact assessments, or to its potential and limitations. Finally, it analyses how the risk-based approach can be implemented in practice by providing technical analyses of various data protection risk management methodologies. © Raphaël Gellert 2020.

AB  - Traditional public health methods for detecting infectious disease transmission, such as contact tracing and molecular epidemiology, are time-consuming and costly. Information and communication technologies, such as global positioning systems, smartphones, and mobile phones, offer opportunities for novel approaches to identifying transmission hotspots. However, mapping the movements of potentially infected persons comes with ethical challenges. During an interdisciplinary meeting of researchers, ethicists, data security specialists, information and communication technology experts, epidemiologists, microbiologists, and others, we arrived at suggestions to mitigate the ethical concerns of movement mapping. These suggestions include a template Data Protection Impact Assessment that follows European Union General Data Protection Regulations. © 2019 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

AB  - Privacy and Data protection are highly complex issues within eHealth/M-Health systems. These systems should meet specific requirements deriving from the organizations and users, as well as from the variety of legal obligations deriving from GDPR that dictate protection rights of data subjects and responsibilities of data controllers. To address that, this paper proposes a Privacy and Data Protection Framework that provides the appropriate steps so as the proper technical, organizational and procedural measures to be undertaken. The framework, beyond previous literature, supports the combination of privacy by design principles with the newly introduced GDPR requirements in order to create a strong elicitation process for deriving the set of the technical security and privacy requirements that should be addressed. It also proposes a process for validating that the elicited requirements are indeed fulfilling the objectives addressed during the Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), carried out according to the GDPR. © 2020, ComSIS Consortium.

AB  - Community Health Workers (CHWs) have been using Mobile Health Data Collection Systems (MDCSs) for supporting the delivery of primary healthcare and carrying out public health surveys, feeding national-level databases with families' personal data. Such systems are used for public surveillance and to manage sensitive data (i.e., health data), so addressing the privacy issues is crucial for successfully deploying MDCSs. In this paper we present a comprehensive privacy threat analysis for MDCSs, discuss the privacy challenges and provide recommendations that are specially useful to health managers and developers. We ground our analysis on a large-scale MDCS used for primary care (GeoHealth) and a well-known Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) methodology. The threat analysis is based on a compilation of relevant privacy threats from the literature as well as brain-storming sessions with privacy and security experts. Among the main findings, we observe that existing MDCSs do not employ adequate controls for achieving transparency and interveinability. Thus, threatening fundamental privacy principles regarded as data quality, right to access and right to object. Furthermore, it is noticeable that although there has been significant research to deal with data security issues, the attention with privacy in its multiple dimensions is prominently lacking. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Community-based primary care focuses on health promotion, awareness raising, and illnesses treatment and prevention in individuals, groups, and communities. Community Health Workers (CHWs) are the leading actors in such programs, helping to bridge the gap between the population and the health system. Many mobile health (mHealth) initiatives have been undertaken to empower CHWs and improve the data collection process in the primary care, replacing archaic paper-based approaches. A special category of mHealth apps, known as mHealth Data Collection Systems (MDCSs), is often used for such tasks. These systems process highly sensitive personal health data of entire communities so that a careful consideration about privacy is paramount for any successful deployment. However, the mHealth literature still lacks methodologically rigorous analyses for privacy and data protection. Objective: In this paper, a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) for MDCSs is presented, providing a systematic identification and evaluation of potential privacy risks, particularly emphasizing controls and mitigation strategies to handle negative privacy impacts. Methods: The privacy analysis follows a systematic methodology for PIAs. As a case study, we adopt the GeoHealth system, a large-scale MDCS used by CHWs in the Family Health Strategy, the Brazilian program for delivering community-based primary care. All the PIA steps were taken on the basis of discussions among the researchers (privacy and security experts). The identification of threats and controls was decided particularly on the basis of literature reviews and working group meetings among the group. Moreover, we also received feedback from specialists in primary care and software developers of other similar MDCSs in Brazil. Results: The GeoHealth PIA is based on 8 Privacy Principles and 26 Privacy Targets derived from the European General Data Protection Regulation. Associated with that, 22 threat groups with a total of 97 subthreats and 41 recommended controls were identified. Among the main findings, we observed that privacy principles can be enhanced on existing MDCSs with controls for managing consent, transparency, intervenability, and data minimization. Conclusions: Although there has been significant research that deals with data security issues, attention to privacy in its multiple dimensions is still lacking for MDCSs in general. New systems have the opportunity to incorporate privacy and data protection by design. Existing systems will have to address their privacy issues to comply with new and upcoming data protection regulations. However, further research is still needed to identify feasible and cost-effective solutions. © Leonardo Horn Iwaya, Simone Fischer-Hübner, Rose-Mharie Åhlfeldt, Leonardo A Martucci.

AB  - The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) caused several new legal requirements software systems in Europe have to comply to. Support for these requirements given by proprietary software systems is limited. Here, an integrative approach of combining software development with GDPR-specific demands is necessary. In this paper, we outline such an approach on the level of software source code. We illustrate how to annotate data in complex software systems and how to use such annotations for task like data visualization, data exchange standardization, and GDPR-specific consent and purpose management systems. Thereby, we outline a research agenda for subsequent efforts in aligning software development and GDPR requirements. © 2019 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

AB  - Modern applications in the Smart Building and Industry 4.0 scenarios will be complex software ecosystems with strict requirements of geographic distribution, heterogeneity, dynamic evolution, security and privacy protection, highly more challenging than the ones required by the current environments. Two of the main challenges arising in the current Internet Of Things scenarios, i.e., the Smart Building one, are, on one side, the requirement of interconnecting several heterogeneous platforms and smart Things in the same environment and, on the other side, the need to be able to evolve the complex software ecosystem deployed, reacting automatically and at runtime to environmental changes, without the human intervention. To address these challenges, BRAIN-IoT establishes a framework and methodology supporting smart cooperative behaviour in fully de-centralized, composable and dynamic federations of heterogeneous Internet of Things platforms. In this way, BRAIN-IoT enables smart autonomous behaviour in Internet of Things scenarios, involving heterogeneous sensors and actuators autonomously cooperating to execute complex, dynamic tasks. Furthermore, BRAIN-IoT enables dynamically deploying and orchestrating distributed applications, allowing the automatic installation and replacement of smart behaviours reacting to environmental changes and User events. Finally, BRAIN-IoT provides a set of components that guarantee the security and privacy protection of the data exchanged using the solution. BRAIN-IoT is a general purpose solution that aims at being adaptable for heterogeneous scenarios, from Service Robotics to Critical Infrastructure Management. This paper introduces a Smart Building use case of the solution, which allows highlighting the advantages given by BRAIN-IoT in such scenario. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - The use of algorithms in modern data processing techniques, as well as data-intensive technological trends, suggests the adoption of a broader view of the data protection impact assessment. This will force data controllers to go beyond the traditional focus on data quality and security, and consider the impact of data processing on fundamental rights and collective social and ethical values. Building on studies of the collective dimension of data protection, this article sets out to embed this new perspective in an assessment model centred on human rights (Human Rights, Ethical and Social Impact Assessment-HRESIA). This self-assessment model intends to overcome the limitations of the existing assessment models, which are either too closely focused on data processing or have an extent and granularity that make them too complicated to evaluate the consequences of a given use of data. In terms of architecture, the HRESIA has two main elements: a self-assessment questionnaire and an ad hoc expert committee. As a blueprint, this contribution focuses mainly on the nature of the proposed model, its architecture and its challenges; a more detailed description of the model and the content of the questionnaire will be discussed in a future publication drawing on the ongoing research. © 2018 Alessandro Mantelero

AB  - Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) play a crucial role in providing privacy protection for data subjects and supporting risk management. From an engineering perspective, the core of a PIA is a risk assessment, which typically follows a step-by-step process of risk identification and risk mitigation. In order for a PIA to be holistic and effective, it needs to be complemented by an appropriate privacy risk model that considers legal, organisational, societal and technical aspects. We propose a data-centric approach for identifying and analysing potential privacy risks in a comprehensive manner. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.

AB  - The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has recently come into effect and insofar as Internet of Things (IoT) applications touch EU citizens or their data, developers are obliged to exercise due diligence and ensure they undertake Data Protection by Design and Default (DPbD). GDPR mandates the use of Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) as a key heuristic enabling DPbD. However, research has shown that developers generally lack the competence needed to deal effectively with legal aspects of privacy management and that the difficulties of complying with regulation are likely to grow considerably. Privacy engineering seeks to shift the focus from interpreting texts and guidelines or consulting legal experts to embedding data protection within the development process itself. There are, however, few examples in practice. We present a privacy-oriented, flow-based integrated development environment (IDE) for building domestic IoT applications. The IDE enables due diligence in (a) helping developers reason about personal data during the actual in vivo construction of IoT applications; (b) advising developers as to whether or not the design choices they are making occasion the need for a DPIA; and (c) attaching and making available to others (including data processors, data controllers, data protection officers, users and supervisory authorities) specific privacy-related information that has arisen during an application’s development. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The development of smart cities has several privacy implications and it challenges the application and enforcement of data protection law. The SPECTRE project looks at these challenges through the lens of the disciplines of law, communication sciences and economics. The aim is to explore and propose legitimate, participatory and economically-sound solutions for enhancing data protection. SPECTRE will argue for greater responsibilisation in the smart city environment, by increasing participation of different stakeholders through the development of a collaborative, cost-efficient Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) methodology. Furthermore, the potential of using public procurement rules to incorporate this new method for a DPIA to effectively deal with the privacy impacts of smart cities will be explored. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Data protection by design aims to reduce possible privacy harms that fog applications may cause by combining it with the data protection impact assessment (DPIA) and the data protection enhancing technologies. This chapter classifies fog/edge/Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, analyzes the latest restrictions introduced by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and discusses how these legal constraints affect the design and operation of IoT applications in fog and cloud environments. The GDPR introduces the data subject's right to data portability. It provides the right to obtain from the controller those data in a structured and commonly used electronic format. Secured systems combining with the data processing principles consists of privacy by default or, with the GDPR words, data protection by default (DPbD). Basically, DPbD is related to the data minimization principle and orders to the data controller to collect the minimum possible personal data during the services. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - This chapter provides an overview on state actor’s opinions and strategies relating to cybersecurity matters. These are addressed on the EU level as well as on the level of the individual European Member States while the focus is on legislation, policy and political approaches to cybersecurity. In this context, many different measures and approaches are taken both in the Union and nationally to streamline knowledge, resources, and measures to combat cybercrime. Furthermore, the role of the new European data protection framework is addressed, and it is explained why data protection has a close relationship to security matters. The main tensions and conflicts in relation to IT and cybersecurity are depicted, which evolve primarily around the frequently negative effect of IT and cybersecurity measures on the rights of data subjects. However, the issue of governmental surveillance is also addressed, with its implications for the fundamental rights of European citizens. Solution approaches to align the two domains of data protection and cybersecurity are explored, since cybersecurity incidents often involve the loss or compromise of an individual’s personal information. To this end, overlaps and synergies are examined that seem promising for a more holistic approach to cyber threats. For instance, this could be achieved by applying principles such as data protection by design and default in IT more thoroughly. In addition, methodologies of data protection impact assessments as well as a more broad deployment of technical and organisational measures while using well-known information security best practices and standards can help to enhance cybersecurity across the European Union. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - It is increasingly recognised that Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) play a crucial role in providing privacy protection for data subjects and in supporting risk management for organisations. However, existing PIA processes are typically not accompanied with proper guidelines and/or methodologies that sufficiently support privacy risk assessments and illustrate precisely how the core part of the PIA—a risk assessment—can be conducted. We present an approach for assessing potential privacy risks built upon a privacy risk model that considers legal, organisational, societal and technical aspects. This approach has the potential to underpin a systematic and traceable privacy risk-assessment methodology that can complement PIA processes. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.

AB  - Recent years have seen many privacy violations that have cost both the users of software systems and the businesses that run them in a variety of ways. One potential cause of these violations may be the ad hoc nature of the implementation of privacy measures within software systems, which may stem from the poor representation of privacy within many Software Development LifeCycle (SDLC) processes. We propose to give privacy a higher priority within the SDLC through the creation of a confederated Privacy-Aware SDLC (PASDLC) which incorporates the Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) lifecycle. The PASDLC brings stakeholders of the software system closer together through the implementation of multiple interception points, whilst prompting the stakeholders to consider privacy within the software system. We consider many challenges to the creation of the PASDLC, including potential communication issues from confederating the processes of a SDLC and the effective measurement of privacy as an attribute of a software system. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Purpose: In care homes concerns about abuse have established a culture where all information pertaining to a person must be shared, and little attention is paid to privacy in its broader sense. The purpose of this paper is to take a human rights perspective and consider how information governance may impact on the health, well-being and quality of life of residents. It proposes a proactive approach and presents a template for a privacy impact assessment which services could use to improve their approach to privacy, protecting the human rights of those in their care, contributing to their independence and improving outcomes. Design/methodology/approach: A review of historical and current thinking about the value of privacy in human services and wider society leads to a series of challenges to the way in which privacy is upheld in residential care services. Findings: Recent preoccupations with data privacy have led to a myopic neglect of broader considerations of privacy. Whilst it continues to be important to protect the confidentiality of personal data and to ensure that residents are protected from abuse, human services that provide 24 hour care in congregated settings must not neglect broader components of privacy. Research limitations/implications: Privacy impact assessments have been widely used to check whether data privacy is being upheld. The broader concept that might be termed “Big Privacy” is introduced within which data privacy is but one section. It is suggested that big privacy is severely compromised in residential care settings, thus denying residents their human right to privacy. The extent of such violation of rights should be investigated. Practical implications: Having set out the potential reach of the human right to privacy, important work needs to be done to find out how privacy might be upheld in the real world of congregate residential care. Some service providers may have solutions to the organisational challenges, have addressed staff training needs and revised risk assessment strategies so that privacy is upheld alongside other rights. Social implications: Nearly half a million people live in congregate residential care settings in England, and deprivation of privacy is argued to be a significant deprivation of human rights. Occasional tragedies and scandals in congregate settings create pressure for increasing the level of surveillance, and the right to privacy is sacrificed. This paper offers a challenge to this process, arguing that competing rights need to be balanced and privacy is an essential component of a decent quality of life. Originality/value: Personal growth and development depends to some extent on choice and control over access to privacy. Recent changes in the law regarding data protection have narrowed our thinking about privacy until it is a small concept, largely concerned with data handling. This paper invites consideration of big privacy, and invites congregate residential care settings to consider how a deep and broad definition of privacy could transform these services. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The GDPR requires all businesses to conduct a risk analysis of the processing of personal data. If this analysis shows that there is a high risk, it will be mandatory to perform a DPIA in order to foresee the impacts and risks this may pose to the privacy of the interested parties. On this basis, the GDPR requires the implementation of security and control measures to guarantee the rights and freedoms of individuals. This paper focuses, on the one hand, on analysing when a cooperative society must carry out a DPIA and, on the other hand, on studying the phases involved in conducting a DPIA correctly. © 2020 University of Deusto.

AB  - Building software-intensive systems that respect the fundamental rights to privacy and data protection requires explicitly addressing data protection issues at the early development stages. Data Protection by Design (DPbD) – as coined by Article 25(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) – therefore calls for an iterative approach based on (i) the notion of risk to data subjects, (ii) a close collaboration between the involved stakeholders, and (iii) accountable decision-making. In practice, however, the legal reasoning behind DPbD is often conducted on the basis of informal system descriptions that lack systematicity and reproducibility. This affects the quality of Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA) – i. e. the concrete manifestation of DPbD at the organizational level. This is a major stumbling block when it comes to conducting a comprehensive and durable assessment of the risks that takes both the legal and technical complexities into account. In this article, we present DPMF, a data protection modeling framework that allows for a comprehensive and accurate description of the data processing operations in terms of the key concepts used in the GDPR. The proposed modeling approach accommodates a number of legal reasonings and assessments that are commonly addressed in a DPIA exercise (e. g., the compatibility of purposes). The DPMF is supported in a prototype modeling tool and its practical applicability is validated in the context of a realistic eHealth system for a number of complementary development scenarios. © 2020, Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI).

AB  - Background: The General Regulation on Data Protection (GDPR) modernizes and harmonizes personal data protection laws across the European Union, affecting all economic sectors including the healthcare industry. The new regulation introduces two specific duties: the Record of Processing Activities (ROPA) and, for each high-risk processing, the Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA). Currently, there are no specific DPIA methodologies for the healthcare environment, but only broad methodologies applicable in all economic sectors. Objectives: This work aims to propose a methodology to perform DPIA for healthcare information systems, considering the specific constraints and criticisms posed by the heterogenous and highly sensitive nature of data and software use in hospitals. Methods: We first performed a GDPR analysis and an examination of other sources regarding DPIA. This analysis led to the identification of issues related to GDPR application in the healthcare environment. We then developed a workflow for DPIA execution, and implemented a software to apply it in a real environment. The methodology was applied on 11 softwares and devices already in use in the Trieste area, Italy. Results: The most important issue identified in the analysis is the definition of “processing activity”, which was overcome by focusing the methodology on the information system processing the data instead of the processing activity per se. We therefore designed a workflow for the risk assessment of an information system establishing that the DPIA shall be performed after the purchase, usually a bid with strict IT security requirements of the information system, but before its deployment in the real environment. The validation of the developed software to implement the workflow on the 11 softwares showed the ability of the proposed workflow to perform the DPIA, and to uncover some important issues in the examined systems. Conclusions: The proposed methodology can be applied to perform DPIA in the healthcare environment by supporting risk evaluation and management, focusing on each software component added to the healthcare information system. © 2020

AB  - The assessment of the potential impact for an organization from a privacy violation incident is important for three main reasons: the organization will have a justified estimate of the cost (financial, reputation or other) that may be raised, will facilitate the selection of the appropriate technical, procedural and organizational protection mechanisms and also will be compliant with the new General Data Protection Regulation that will be in effect from May 2018. Today, there are several methods to do a Privacy Impact Assessment but none of these quantifies the results according to specific metrics and thus can be significantly affected by various subjective parameters. Furthermore, the specific organizational characteristics (size, activities, number of clients, type of offered services etc.) are very rarely accounted, a fact that also affects the accuracy of the results. In this paper, a privacy impact assessment method that explicitly takes into account the organizational characteristics and employs a list of well-defined metrics as input, is presented. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - In this paper we describe how we designed a massive open online course (mooc) on Privacy by Design with a focus on how to achieve compliance with the eu gdpr principles and requirements in it engineering and management. This mooc aims at educating both professionals and undergraduate students, i.e., target groups with distinct educational needs and requirements, within a single course structure. We discuss why developing and publishing such a course is a timely decision and fulfills the current needs of the professional and undergraduate education. The mooc is organized in five modules, each of them with its own learning outcomes and activities. The modules focus on different aspects of the gdpr that data protection officers have to be knowledgeable about, ranging from the legal basics, to data protection impact assessment methods, and privacy-enhancing technologies. The modules were delivered using hypertext, digital content and three video production styles: slides with voice-over, talking heads and interviews. The main contribution of this work is the roadmap on how to design a highly relevant mooc on privacy by design and the gdpr aimed at an heterogeneous audience. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2018.

AB  - The General Data Protection Regulation mandates that data controllers conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)for certain processing activities. The core of the substance of the DPIA obligation requires that data controllers engage in 'an assessment of the risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects [posed by the processing operation]'. A common interpretation has emerged that this obligation only requires data controllers to engage in a 'compliance assessment': an assessment of the risks of processing considering the concrete provisions of the GDPR. This article takes issue with this interpretation and offers an elab-orated conceptual argument supporting the following, alternative, position: the obligation that the DPIA risk assessment process include 'an assessment of the risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects' requires data controllers to take the complete catalogue of rights and freedoms, outlined in foundational European fundamental rights instruments, as the key normative reference point for the DPIA risk assessment process. © 2020, Lexxion Verlagsgesellschaft mbH.

AB  - In the data economy, many organisations, particularly SMEs may not be in a position to generate large amounts of data themselves, but may benefit from reusing data previously collected by others. Organisations that collect large amounts of data themselves may also benefit from reusing such data for other purposes than originally envisioned. However, under the current EU personal data protection legal framework, constituted by the General Data Protection Regulation, there are clear limits and restrictions to the reuse of personal data. Data can only be reused for purposes that are compatible with the original purposes for which the data were collected and processed. This is at odds with the reality of the data economy, in which there is a considerable need for data reuse. To address this issue, in this article we present the concept of a Data Reuse Impact Assessment (DRIA), which can be considered as an extension to existing Privacy and Data Protection Impact Assessments (PIAs and DPIAs). By adding new elements to these existing tools that specifically focus on the reuse of data and aspects regarding data ethics, a DRIA may typically be helpful to strike a better balance between the protection of personal data that is being reused and the need for data reuse in the data economy. Using a DRIA may contribute to increased trust among data subjects that their personal data is adequately protected. Data subjects, in turn, may then be willing to share more data, which on the long term may also be beneficial for the data economy. © (Publication Year), (publisher Name). All rights reserved.

AB  - Article 35 of the GDPR introduces the legal obligation to perform DPIAs in cases where the processing operations are likely to present high risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. This obligation is part of a change of approach in the GDPR towards a modified compliance scheme in terms of a reinforced principle of accountability. The DPIA is a prominent example of this approach given that it has an inclusive, comprehensive and proactive nature. Its importance lies in the fact that it forces data controllers to identify, assess and ultimately manage the high risks to the rights and freedoms. However, what is first and foremost important for a meaningful performance of DPIAs, is to have a common and objective understanding of what constitutes a risk in the field of data protection and of how to assess its likelihood and severity. The legislature has approached these concepts via the method of denotation, meaning by giving examples of (highly) risky processing operations. This article suggests a complementary approach, the connotation of these concepts and explains the added value of such a method. By way of a case-study the article also demonstrates the importance of performing complete and accurate DPIAs, in terms of contributing to improving the protection of personal data. © 2019 Katerina Demetzou

AB  - In this paper, we compared the requirements of previously developed manual and ISO/IEC 29134:2017 and analyzed the changes. As a result, there were no major differences in requirements. It is useful to conduct a privacy impact assessment (PIA) before actually operating the system to appropriately construct and operate a system that handles personal information. A manual (procedure manual) is necessary to implement PIA efficiently. In June 2017, ISO issued the ISO/IEC 29134:2017 as an international standard on PIA. Cause the past PIA manual developed based on ISO 22307:2008, development of a PIA manual conforming to ISO/IEC 29134:2017 was required. By our analysis, as a newly stated matter, ISO/IEC 29134:2017 explicitly indicated Due Diligence, stakeholder engagement, and risk countermeasures. Based on the analysis results, we propose a new PIA manual reflecting the requirements of ISO/IEC 29134:2017. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.

AB  - Modern societies have developed a variety of technologies and techniques to identify, measure and influence people and objects. Smart devices such as smartphones and wearables assist and track their users in every aspect of life. Large amounts of data are collected, evaluated and interconnected to analyse the behaviour of individuals, social groups and collectives. By discussing recent practices of self-tracking as well of real-time control of complex systems, we will show that real-time analysis and feedback loops increasingly foster a society of (self-)control. Data scientists and social scientists should work together to develop the concepts of regulation, which are needed to cope with the challenges and risks of big data. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This book offers an analysis of privacy impacts resulting from and reinforced by technology and discusses fundamental risks and challenges of protecting privacy in the digital age. Privacy is among the most endangered "species" in our networked society: personal information is processed for various purposes beyond our control. Ultimately, this affects the natural interplay between privacy, personal identity and identification. This book investigates that interplay from a systemic, socio-technical perspective by combining research from the social and computer sciences. It sheds light on the basic functions of privacy, their relation to identity, and how they alter with digital identification practices. The analysis reveals a general privacy control dilemma of (digital) identification shaped by several interrelated socio-political, economic and technical factors. Uncontrolled increases in the identification modalities inherent to digital technology reinforce this dilemma and benefit surveillance practices, thereby complicating the detection of privacy risks and the creation of appropriate safeguards. Easing this problem requires a novel approach to privacy impact assessment (PIA), and this book proposes an alternative PIA framework which, at its core, comprises a basic typology of (personally and technically) identifiable information. This approach contributes to the theoretical and practical understanding of privacy impacts and thus, to the development of more effective protection standards. This book will be of much interest to students and scholars of critical security studies, surveillance studies, computer and information science, science and technology studies, and politics. © 2019 Stefan Strauß.

AB  - In this era of digital world, Internet of Things (IoT) plays a vital role almost in every field of engineering. Now a days, almost every system has adopted this technology due to it’s ease in access, design and development. However the technology still suffers from the issues of available resources for computing of huge amount of IoT data. In order to solve these issues, it is necessary to adopt trustworthy cloud based architecture. The trust level calculation of these cloud services is a challenging task. In this paper, we have developed a triple integrated assessment for the trust evaluation of a cloud network. This assessment has been carried out using the three major parameters i.e. security, privacy and reputation. Security assessment of the cloud service has been carried out using the security metrics like security controls deliverable. The privacy assessment is evaluated using the Privacy Impact Assessment(PIA) tool. Finally the reputation assessment of the cloud network is carried out using the reputation of it’s cloud services. Experiments are carried out on different real-world web service datasets which shows that the proposed assessment model works efficiently than all other assessment models. ©BEIESP.

AB  - The present paper presents five concepts that rest in the core of the reasoning of the European and national regulators behind the element of ‘high risk’ under the legal obligation to perform Data Protection Impact Assessments (Article 35 GDPR). These five concepts have been extracted from the national ‘blacklists’ published by 15 Data Protection Authorities and are the following: control, reasonable expectations, (negative) impact on rights and interests, scaling-up and identifiability. In cases where control over one’s personal data is compromised or not guaranteed, where the reasonable expectations of the data subject over the processing of their personal data are not met, where processing operations have a negative impact on rights, freedoms, interests and the daily life activities of natural persons, where the processing scales-up and becomes broader and/or deeper and where the level of identifiability is high, then it is likely that a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons is raised. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Technological change has been notable in recent decades, including the field of assistive technologies aimed at promoting the autonomy of the elderly and disabled people. Personal autonomy is possible thanks to ethical-juridical protection through reciprocally recognized human rights (civil and political, economic, social and cultural, third generation). The current technological change could produce an alteration in the exercise of personal autonomy, putting at risk its normative protection, since some of these rights currently require technological mediations to be able to be carried out. Nowadays, the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) governs as the international normative framework that defines and protects the autonomy of people with disabilities, mostly elderly, and includes important references to technological developments. New assistive technologies, that can be used to record physiological variables or to monitor habitual patterns of life, are suggested as devices that promote personal autonomy. Health monitoring could impact privacy, identity, integrity, and the protection of personal data. Therefore, it is necessary to broaden the ethical reflection from the CRPD to the relevant regulations on privacy and data protection (General Data Protection Regulation [GDPR] and Draft Privacy Regulation ePrivacy) and the Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) provided in Art. 35 GDPR, which is especially relevant for the realm of assistive technologies. In this contribution we show how technological change affects some aspects of personal autonomy, its normative protection, privacy, and care. © 2020 Joschka Haltaufderheide, Johanna Hovemann, Jochen Vollmann, published by Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - This work answers the following question, how to gather and act on personal data in smart city projects using boundary objects? Smart city projects require new mapping methods so they can share and discuss work collectively. Working collectively is necessary because smart city projects are difficult to map in one singular view for personal data because different smart city stakeholders have a part of the required information. Summarising data processing operations is most often taken for granted and under-defined in Data Protection Impact Assessment methods. This paper is a plea for the use of boundary objects for GDPR compliance and research in smart cities. Therefore, this article is a comparison of the original context boundary objects with the context of smart cities to illustrate the need for a similar approach. The main results of this paper point to a new approach to enable collaborative GDPR compliance where specialist knowledge trickles down to developers and other actors not educated to comply with GDPR requirements. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2019.

AB  - Cybersecurity Systems (CSSs) play a fundamental role in guaranteeing data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. However, while processing data, CSSs can intentionally or unintentionally expose personal information to people that can misuse them. For this reason, privacy implications of a CSS should be carefully evaluated. This is a challenging task mainly because modern CSSs have complex architectures and components. Moreover, data processed by CSSs can be exposed to different actors, both internal and external to the organization. This contribution presents a methodology, called EPIC, that is specifically designed to evaluate privacy violation risks in cybersecurity systems. Differently, from other general purpose guidelines, EPIC is an operational methodology aimed at guiding security and privacy experts with step-by-step instructions from modeling data exposure in the CSS to the systematical identification of privacy threats and evaluation of their associated privacy violation risk. This contribution also shows the application of the EPIC methodology to the use case of a large academic organization CSS protecting over 15, 000 hosts. © 2018, University of Skovde.

AB  - Due to their organisational characteristics, many charities are poorly prepared for the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We present an exemplar process for implementing GDPR and the DPIA Data Wheel, a DPIA framework devised as part of the case study, that accounts for these characteristics. We validate this process and framework by conducting a GDPR implementation with a charity that works with vulnerable adults. This charity processes both special category (sensitive) and personally identifiable data. This GDPR implementation was conducted and devised for the charity sector, but can be equally applied in any organisation that need to implement GDPR or conduct DPIAs. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2019.

AB  - Technologies to measure gaze direction and pupil reactivity have become efficient, cheap, and compact and are finding increasing use in many fields, including gaming, marketing, driver safety, military, and healthcare. Besides offering numerous useful applications, the rapidly expanding technology raises serious privacy concerns. Through the lens of advanced data analytics, gaze patterns can reveal much more information than a user wishes and expects to give away. Drawing from a broad range of scientific disciplines, this paper provides a structured overview of personal data that can be inferred from recorded eye activities. Our analysis of the literature shows that eye tracking data may implicitly contain information about a user’s biometric identity, gender, age, ethnicity, body weight, personality traits, drug consumption habits, emotional state, skills and abilities, fears, interests, and sexual preferences. Certain eye tracking measures may even reveal specific cognitive processes and can be used to diagnose various physical and mental health conditions. By portraying the richness and sensitivity of gaze data, this paper provides an important basis for consumer education, privacy impact assessments, and further research into the societal implications of eye tracking. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Unlike the classical risk analysis that protects the assets of the company in question, the GDPR protects data subject’s rights and freedoms, that is, the right to data protection and the right to have full control and knowledge about data processing concerning them. The GDPR articulates Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) in article 35. DPIA is a risk-based process to enhance and demonstrate compliance with these requirements. We propose a methodology to conduct the DPIA in three steps and provide a supporting tool. In this paper, we particularly elaborate on risk analysis as a step of this methodology. The provided tool assists controllers to facilitate data subject’s rights and freedoms. The assistance that our tool provides differentiates our work from the existing ones. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2020.

AB  - Risk management is a well-known method to face technological challenges through a win–win combination of protective and proactive approaches, fostering the collaboration of operators, researchers, regulators, and industries for the exploitation of new markets. In the field of autonomous and unmanned aerial systems, or UAS, a considerable amount of work has been devoted to risk analysis, the generation of ground risk maps, and ground risk assessment by estimating the fatality rate. The paper aims to expand this approach with a tool for managing data protection risks raised by drones through the design of flight maps. The tool should allow UAS operators choosing the best air corridor for their drones based on the so-called privacy by design principle pursuant to Article 25 of the EU data protection regulation, the GDPR. Among the manifold applications of this approach, the design of fly zones for drones can be tailored for public authorities in the phase of authorization of new operations, much as for national Data Protection authorities that have to control the lawfulness of personal data processing by UAS operations. The overall aim is to present the first win–win approach to data protection issues, aerospace engineering challenges, and risk management methods for the threats posed by this technology. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Impact assessments have received particular attention on both sides of the Atlantic as a tool for implementing algorithmic accountability. The aim of this paper is to address how Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) (Art. 35) in the European Union (EU)'s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) link the GDPR's two approaches to algorithmic accountability-individual rights and systemic governance-and potentially lead to more accountable and explainable algorithms. We argue that algorithmic explanation should not be understood as a static statement, but as a circular and multi-layered transparency process based on several layers (general information about an algorithm, group-based explanations, and legal justification of individual decisions taken). We argue that the impact assessment process plays a crucial role in connecting internal company heuristics and risk mitigation to outward-facing rights, and in forming the substance of several kinds of explanations. © 2020 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - The General Data Protection Regulation has propelled privacy to an equal requirement with security for data protection. A key regulation requirement is data protection by design and a corresponding data protection impact assessment that details security and privacy by design for a project processing data. Security and privacy of data in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) handles sensitive health data and accordingly is bound by additional regulatory safety, security and privacy requirements. Health data in the IoMT can potentially flow through a diversity of apps, systems, devices and technologies, open networks. This exposes the transmitted data in the IoMT to additional attack surfaces and consequently increases on the need for security and privacy. Applying security and privacy regulatory requirements is a struggle for developers in small to medium enterprises due to a lack of knowledge, understanding, training, experience and financial constraints. This paper proposes a framework aimed at developers in small to medium enterprises, to assist in meeting regulatory requirements for security and privacy of data in flow in the IoMT. This framework expands on the basic established threat modeling steps to apply both security and privacy properties to protect data in flow in the IoMT. The framework includes a set of categorised technical security and privacy controls developed through medical device security standards to mitigate identified security and privacy threats. This framework also provides a foundation for the administration of a data protection impact assessment. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Data Protection by Design (DPbD) is a truly interdisciplinary effort that involves many stakeholders such as legal experts, requirements engineers, software architects, developers, and system operators. Building software-intensive systems that respect the fundamental rights to privacy and data protection is the result of intensive dialogue and careful trade-off decisions. In practice however, there is a dichotomy between the legal reasoning which is conducted in Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA) and software engineering approaches, such as threat modeling, aimed at identifying privacy requirements and privacy risks. These activities are commonly performed in total isolation, which negatively impacts (i) the compliance exercise, (ii) the ability to evolve the system over time, and (iii) the architectural trade-offs made during system design. In this article, we present an architectural viewpoint for describing software architectures from a legal, data protection perspective whose core modeling abstractions are based on an in-depth legal analysis of the EU General Data Protection Regulation. This viewpoint is tied to Data Flow Diagrams-commonly used in threat modeling-through correspondence rules. The proposed viewpoint supports the automation of a number of data protection impact assessment steps through (i) meta-model constraints, (ii) model analysis, and (iii) interaction with the involved stakeholders. This enables a streamlined compliance exercise, reconciling legal privacy and data protection notions with architecture-driven software engineering practices. We validate our approach in the context of a realistic e-health application for a number of complementary development scenarios. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - After the adoption of new data protection regulations, like GDPR, proper treatment of privacy throughout the system development lifecycle has become a must. In this paper, we discuss several aspects to more easily and effectively integrate privacy engineering in system development and how to bring the notion of privacy-by-design into practice. We propose the new W-model as a privacy-aware extension of the V-model frequently used in software engineering. One stage of the W-model deals with analyzing privacy in the system where privacy engineers conduct a privacy impact assessment in order to elicit privacy threats and to find a suitable countermeasure to remedy each threat. With respect to finding suitable countermeasures, we provide requirements the countermeasures need to meet in order to be selected. In addition, we introduce a cost function that assists privacy engineers in selecting the most suitable countermeasure. Furthermore, we point out several open issues that future work needs to address. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper, an e-health architecture offering secure remote medical services using WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) enhanced with contextual health information coming from medical connected sensors, is proposed and analyzed. The goal is to allow patients (injured, elderly, disabled, etc.) to benefit from a medical assistance just by calling a remote medical support (doctors, nurses, etc.) using a real-time communication technology such as WebRTC. Moreover, the advancement of the medical devices, on one side, and the emergence of the Web of Things (WoT), on the other side, makes this approach possible. Hence, granting the users the ability of monitoring their own health status and an awareness of their health condition. However, in such architectures, in order for the users to access these services, they need to provide and exchange personal data, and in particular the health related ones. Therefore, user's private information may be exposed to privacy violation and disclosure. Understanding the privacy holes regarding the protection of the personal health related data, identifying the privacy leakage points and studying the privacy requirements are important in order to propose a privacy safeguard for the proposed healthcare architecture, which is the aim of this paper. Additionally, a risk analysis, the sources of these risks and the possible countermeasures are also conducted during this process. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - This chapter focuses on the requirements for data breach notification and communication under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). GDPR is aimed to be addressing the European Commission’s Digital Single Market Strategy that focuses on enabling businesses and governments to fully benefit from digitalization that would thrive the European market while protecting the individual’s fundamental right to privacy. GDPR is applicable internationally, therefore businesses all around the world might be required to comply with the GDPR data breach obligations. In the current cyber threat landscape, the increased risk of data breaches as well as extraterritorial applicability of the GDPR draw much attention to GDPR and data breaches. This chapter briefly introduces the impor-tance and relevance of GDPR, GDPR data breach notification, and communication requirements as well as risk assessment methods under the GDPR and contemporary case examples on data breach incidents. The chapter provides an overview of the relevant provisions of the GDPR and points out examples that can serve as guidelines on data protection impact assessment approaches. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - Privacy and data protection have become more and more important in the recent years since an increasing number of enterprises and startups are harvesting personal data as a part of their business model. One central requirement of the GDPR is the implementation of a data protection impact assessment for privacy critical systems. However, the law does not dictate a special assessment methods. In this paper we compare different data protection impact assessment methods. We have developed a comparison and evaluation methodology and applied this to three of the most widespread assessment frameworks. The result of this comparison shows the weaknesses and strength, but also clearly indicates that none of the tested methods fulfills all desired properties. Thus, the development of a new or improved data protection impact assessment framework is an important open issue for future work. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - With the introduction of the Radiation Protection Act (StrlSchG) and the Radiation Protection Regulations (StrlSchV), which “replaced” the Roentgen Regulations (RöV) on 31 December 2018, there has been little change regarding teleradiology-specific requirements. Nevertheless, the data protection requirements of the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) also apply to teleradiology. Primarily, any processing of healthcare data is prohibited if there is no legal basis for permission. Thereafter, the established principles laid down in Art. 5 GDPR must be demonstrably fulfilled, patients must be informed and the security of the data must be guaranteed, etc. It is fundamentally necessary to clarify on what legal basis the cooperation between the treating hospital and the teleradiologist takes place: is it an independent treatment by the teleradiologist alone or is it more a joint processing in the sense of Art. 26 GDPR? If teleradiology is using new technologies, e.g. the distribution via a cloud solution, a data protection impact assessment may have to be carried out. Even though many requirements of the GDPR are already addressed by the teleradiological requirements alone and they are already implemented in an approved teleradiology, there are still some points that should be looked at more closely. © 2019, Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature.

AB  - The new general data protection regulation requires organizations to conduct a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) when the processing of personal information may result in high risk to individual rights and freedoms. DPIA allows organizations to identify, assess and prioritize the risks related to the processing of personal information and select suitable mitigations to reduce the severity of the risks. The existing DPIA methodologies measure the severity of privacy risks according to analysts’ opinions about the likelihood and the impact factors of the threats. The assessment is therefore subjective to the expertise of the analysts. To reduce subjectivity, we propose a set of well-defined criteria that analysts can use to measure the likelihood and the impact of a privacy risk. Then, we adopt the fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making approach to systematically measure the severity of privacy risks while modeling the imprecision and vagueness inherent in linguistic assessment. Our approach is illustrated for a realistic scenario with respect to LINDDUN threat categories. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Starting from 25th May 2018, the EU Regulation 2016/679, known as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) - relating to the protection of individuals with regard to the processing and free circulation of personal data - is directly applicable in all Member States. The application of the GDPR caught a lot of companies and institutions unprepared and off guard. One of the most complex activities that the GDPR requires is the Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA). The aim of this paper is to provide an Expert System that is able to draw up the DPIA, and a prototype is shown. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - New projects and initiatives are continuously and increasingly taking place in large organizations. Therefore, privacy teams are legitimately wondering if all these projects need a Data Protection Impact Assessment, and which one need to be supported in priority. And what about other projects? Generally speaking, can these GDPR compliant projects rely on the existing ecosystem? And what to do with processing activities already implemented? Many questions to which we will try to answer in this paper. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to practically guide privacy impact assessment (PIA) implementation by proposing a PIA process incorporating best practices from existing PIA guidelines and privacy research. Design/methodology/approach: This paper critically reviews and assesses generic PIA methods proposed by related research, data protection authorities and standard’s organizations, to identify best practices and practically support PIA practitioners. To address identified gaps, best practices from privacy literature are proposed. Findings: This paper proposes a PIA process based on best practices, as well as an evaluation framework for existing PIA guidelines, focusing on practical support to PIA practitioners. Practical implications: The proposed PIA process facilitates PIA practitioners in organizing and implementing PIA projects. This paper also provides an evaluation framework, comprising a comprehensive set of 17 criteria, for PIA practitioners to assess whether PIA methods/guidelines can adequately support requirements of their PIA projects (e.g. special legal framework and needs for PIA project organization guidance). Originality/value: This research extends PIA guidelines (e.g. ISO 29134) by providing comprehensive and practical guidance to PIA practitioners. The proposed PIA process is based on best practices identified from evaluation of nine commonly used PIA methods, enriched with guidelines from privacy literature, to accommodate gaps and support tasks that were found to be inadequately described or lacking practical guidance. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The smart grid promises to enable novel energy services, supporting a greater integration of renewable energy sources. Major issues in this context are data protection and privacy risks, wherein malicious actors or organizations misuse personal data that is collected, processed and stored to enable these services. To address this problem, the European Commission has proposed a risk-driven process to data protection impact assessment. In this article, we introduce this process and present a tool that can support its implementation. © 2017, Springer Verlag Wien.

AB  - Europe's proposed Data Protection Regulation is expected to make data protection impact assessment (DPIA) mandatory, a development that could impact hundreds of thousands of organizations (both governmental and private sector) in Europe, as well as non-European entities offering their wares and services there. This article reviews the DPIA provisions outlined in the new regulation. For the nuts and bolts of a privacy impact assessment (PIA) methodology, Europe could select features from the PIA methodologies used in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States, the countries with the most experience in PIA. A European Commission (EC)-funded project, called PIAF, reviewed these various methodologies and proposed an "optimized" PIA for Europe (and elsewhere) based on the best practices of the aforementioned countries. Based on these best practices, this article outlines a 16-step PIA process. It argues that while some organizations may regard a PIA as a hassle, in fact, a PIA offers many benefits, as spotlighted in the article. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This has been a big year for privacy with so much going on within the EU regarding reform of data protection. What are the implications of reform here and what are the issues that concern us about the proposed new data protection regime contained in the proposed Regulation? We hear a lot about the 'right to be forgotten'. How is that possible in the digital age within the online world? And what can be done about the big players who stand charged with the erosion of privacy viz Facebook, Google, Skype & YouTube etc? How can the law keep up with technological change when the latter is moving so fast e.g. with RFID, Cloud and social networking? To what extent can data breach notification, net neutrality and privacy impact assessment help and how should the law approach issues of liability and criminality in relation to privacy? What is the state of play too in the relationship between privacy policy and state surveillance and, given its implications for privacy, what obligations should governments adopt in response to cybersecurity regulation and data management? Is there a place for privacy self-regulation and if so in what respects and how effective are the Information Commissioners who often complain of being under resourced? In reviewing the way privacy law has emerged do we now need a completely new approach to the whole issue? Has the law crept into its present form simply by default? Do we need some new thinking now that reflects the fact that law is only one dimension in the battle for privacy? If so what are the other factors we need to recognise?. © 2013 Bristows.

AB  - Privacy Impact Assessments (PIA) are recognized as a key step to enhance privacy protection in new information systems and services. They will be required in Europe when the new General Data Protection Regulation becomes effective. From a technical perspective, the core of a PIA is a Privacy Risk Analysis (PRA), which has received relatively less attention than organizational and legal aspects of PIAs. In this work, we propose a rigorous and systematic PRA methodology. We illustrate it with a quantified self use-case in the extended paper [9]. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.

AB  - This paper describes surveillance impact assessment (SIA), a methodology for identifying, assessing and resolving risks, in consultation with stakeholders, posed by the development of surveillance systems. This paper appears to be the first such to elaborate an SIA methodology. It argues that the process of conducting an SIA should be similar to that of a privacy impact assessment (PIA), but that an SIA must take account of a wider range of issues, impacts and stakeholders. The paper categorises the issues and impacts to be considered in the conduct of an SIA and identifies the benefits of a properly conducted SIA. © 2012 Baker and McKenzie LLP.

AB  - Data privacy regulatory framework is evolving. The long awaited EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) sets new standards by increasing and improving online personal data protection (i.e. privacy). In order for informatics to take and safeguard a firm compliance stand, privacy concerns should be addressed both by design and by default. In the same time special attention is needed as to avoid smothering the added value provided by the (vast) quantity and (low) cost of web-residing-information. By combining regulation, information privacy and best practices into UML use case diagrams, paper in hand examines GDPR requirements by utilizing the educational e-platform paradigm 'Law Courses'1. Ultimately it aims to equip engineers with a GDPR-standards compatible software incorporation case. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - The ability to harness technology in crisis management has enabled an increase in wide-scale interagency collaboration. This development has occurred alongside a move to accumulate and analyse crowdsourced responses. Given the scale and the nature of the information accessed and collected, there is a pressing need to ensure that technology is developed in a way that protects the interests of end-users and stakeholders. Privacy impact assessments (PIAs) are increasingly used, in certain jurisdictions legally mandated, in projects to foresee risks to privacy and to plan strategies to avoid these. Once implemented, the EU's General Data Protection Regulation will, in certain circumstances, require the need for a PIA. This study focuses upon the PIA process in an EU-funded project with the aim of developing cloud-based disaster response technology. It introduces the project and then gives a background to the PIA process. Insights and observations are then made relating to how the PIA operates, with the aim of drawing conclusions that can both improve the current project and be transferable to other crisis management-focused projects. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Health IT is the use of Information Technology (IT) in healthcare to improve patients' experience, enable quality care, efficiency, speed, and security of the collection, exchange, sharing, and storage of sensitive personal information. But Health IT faces a number of notable challenges ranging from privacy risks to trust and confidence in the use of EHRs. In this chapter, a framework for conducting Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) of Health IT projects is discussed. Privacy impact assessment is a process through which privacy risks are assessed. The chapter includes recommendations for mitigating identified risks and ensuring compliance to policy and processes for handling and processing of highly sensitive and Personally Identifiable Information (PII). © 2015, IGI Global.

AB  - This paper provides an overview of the new EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), before analysing some of the new legal requirements in more detail. One such requirement is the one-stop shop — a new mechanism which will require much work at the institutional level as national data protection authorities will be obliged to maintain continuous communication with each other and to coordinate their decisions. With regard to the right to judicial remedy against data controllers, the principle of proximity is essential for the effective protection of data subjects’ rights. Again, however, this will require much work at an institutional level. The role of data protection officer, although established in a number of member states, remains to be fully considered in other member states. The GDPR gives all data controllers the opportunity to enhance their privacy awareness and thus develop a comprehensive understanding of all potential privacy risks in order to take the right countermeasures to mitigate them. In conclusion, the GDPR is to be lauded for addressing many of the crucial obstacles to creating a single digital market. Nevertheless, the complex process of applying the new regulation is only just beginning, and only with the cooperation of data controllers and the various European institutions will it be possible to guarantee its effective and consistent application. © Henry Stewart Publications.

AB  - Several countries prescribe or advise government departments and organizations to perform a privacy impact assessment (PIA) if these prepare new projects or change existing ones that involve personal information. A PIA shall summarize what personal information is collected, processed, stored, and distributed in the context of the project. But there is only little support for undertaking a PIA and to create a PIA report, most countries only provide vague guidelines and simple templates. We present in this paper an extension of the problembased privacy analysis (ProPAn) method that derives information needed to conduct a PIA from a requirements model in problem frame notation. We provide a formally specified method with well-defined steps and tool support to reduce the effort to be spent for eliciting the needed information and to ensure that the needed information is as complete and coherent as possible to form an adequate basis for the creation of a PIA report.

AB  - In 2016, the General Data Protection Regulation has opened a new chapter for the protection of informational privacy in Europe. More than a simple revision of the Data Protection Directive (1995) and less than a regulatory paradigm shift, the Regulation attempts to keep path with technological and socio-economic changes while guaranteeing the persons’ fundamental rights and enabling the control over their data. This contribution aims at examining whether this reform deals adequately with the challenges of the digital era. The analysis gives an overview of the new framework, its background and goals, focusing on some issues that are Internet relevant. In this respect, we discuss the provisions regarding the extended material and territorial scope of the Regulation and the implementation issues that may arise. We also addressed the consent and the way the European legislator tries to foster it as a legal ground of data processing and core manifestation of the right to protection of personal data. Further, we examine the new rights (right to be forgotten, right to data portability) that are introduced in the data protection law to reinforce the individuals’ rights as digital users. By assessing the new framework, we conclude that the changes introduced in combination with innovative regulatory elements, such as privacy by design or data protection impact assessments, constitute an important improvement in the sustaining and maturing of data protection law and may serve to respond to face technological challenges and mitigate risks. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - Democracy in Australia is gravely threatened by a flood of measures harmful to human rights that have been introduced since 2001, a large proportion of which are unjustified and not subject to effective controls. The passage of these measures through the Parliament has been achieved on the basis of their proponents' assertions and without appropriate scrutiny. Parliament had available to it various forms of impact assessment techniques, but failed to require that such methods be applied. The study reported here had as its focus one particular form of evaluation - Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA). The study found that the PIA process should have been performed for each proposal, but was in fact seldom applied, and where it was applied the process and report were in almost all cases seriously deficient. Survival of democracy is dependent on the Parliament standing up to the national security extremism that has taken hold of the Attorney-General's Department. Ministers and Parliamentary Committees must demand prior evaluation of proposals that restrict civil freedoms, must ensure transparency in relation to the proposals and their justification, and must require effective controls over, and mitigation features within, those measures that survive the evaluation process. © 2016 Roger Clarke.

AB  - In this paper, we propose an evaluation scheme which has the objective to permit the user to identify the legal data protection obligations through a continuous data-lifecycle-Assessment-method and to re-design the data processing actively. To ensure the compliance with data protection principles under the European law and thus preventing the risk of sanctions, it is necessary, especially in multi-discipline services, to continuously check during the complete data-usage-process whether personal data are given and which methods of risk minimisation like the application of anonymization techniques are useful.

AB  - RFID is being used increasingly in different applications in numerous industries. Many of these applications involve the collection and storing of sensitive data which should be treated accordingly. In the USA, consumer campaigns and the public atmosphere favouring privacy have influenced RFID system design by preventing piloting the solutions which may pose a risk to privacy. However, in Europe the number of RFID applications has increased without significant public attention towards privacy issues. Therefore, the European Commission attempts to highlight the importance of recognising the impacts of RFID applications towards privacy and the need to protect data by launching the Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) framework. In Finland, where RFID use in companies is among the highest in Europe, RFID providers considered their competence in privacy and data protection issues to be quite high and they considered related legislation at least somewhat important to their business. Alternatively, their awareness on the PIA framework was slightly lower. Copyright © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - In order to address the continued decline in consumer trust in all things digital, and specifically the Internet of Things (IoT), we propose a radical overhaul of IoT design processes. Privacy by Design has been proposed as a suitable framework, but we argue the current approach has two failings: it presents too abstract a framework to inform design, and it is often applied after many critical design decisions have been made in defining the business opportunity. To rebuild trust we need the philosophy of Privacy by Design to be transformed into a wider Social Impact Assessment and delivered with practical guidance to be applied at product/service concept stage as well as throughout the system's engineering. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - In the digital age, the interaction between privacy, data protection and advanced technological developments such as big data analytics has become pertinent to Europol's effectiveness in providing accurate crime analyses. For the purposes of preventing and combating crime falling within the scope of its objectives, it is imperative for Europol to employ the fullest and most up-to-date information and technical capabilities possible whilst respecting fundamental human rights. The present article addresses precisely the “paradox” of on one side protecting fundamental human rights against external terrorist and/or cybercrime intrusions, and on the other providing a privacy-conscious approach to data collection and analytics, so that Europol can even more effectively support and strengthen action in protecting society against internal threats in a proportionate, responsible and legitimate manner. The advantage proposed in this very context of large quantities of data informing strategic analysis at Europol is a purpose-oriented data protection impact assessment. Namely, the evolution from traditional instruments in the fight against organised crime and terrorism to more technologically advanced ones equally requires an alteration of the conventional notions of privacy and investigative and information-sharing methods. © 2017 Daniel Drewer and Vesela Miladinova

AB  - Medical confidentiality is of individual and of general interest. Medical confidentiality is not absolute. European countries differ in their legislative approaches of consent for data-sharing and lawful breaches of medical confidentiality. An increase of interference by the legislator with medical confidentiality is noticeable. In the Netherlands for instance this takes the form of new mandatory duties to report resp. of legislation providing for a release of medical confidentiality in specific situations, often under the condition that reporting takes place on the basis of a professional code that includes elements imposed by the legislator (e.g. (suspicion of ) child abuse, domestic violence). Legislative interference must not result in the patient loosing trust in healthcare. To avoid erosion of medical confidentiality, (comparative) effectiveness studies and privacy impact assessments are necessary (European and national level). Medical confidentiality should be a subject of permanent education of health personnel. © 2014 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.

AB  - Article 33 of the European Commission's proposed Data Protection Regulation would make privacy impact assessments (PIAs) mandatory for those data controllers whose processing operations present specific risks to data subjects (individuals). † The PIAF consortium sought the views of data protection authorities (DPAs) in the European Union on the specifics of a privacy impact assessment (PIA) policy. This paper describes the results of our survey as well as comments made by DPAs in the Article 29 Data Protection Working Party. † PIAF is the acronym for Privacy Impact Assessment Framework, a project carried out for the European Commission. † Among key policy-makers at the European and member state level-that is, the data protection authorities-there appears to be strong support for a PIA policy and for some key features. DPAs were virtually unanimous that the benefits of PIAs exceeded the costs or disadvantages, but have a diversity of views on many of the specifics of a PIA policy. © The Author 2012.

AB  - The future of energy supply lies in smart grids, which enable energy supply to and from consumers. These two-way energy networks require smart energy metering systems. The vision of smart grids will require one or more decades yet to be fully realised, but since a roll-out of smart meters is a lengthy process, countries are already starting to implement smart metering legislation, following the European legal framework on energy efficiency. Rolling out smart meters, however, requires smart legislation. The Dutch example, where the Senate blocked two smart metering bills in 2009, demonstrates that introducing smart meters can be significantly delayed if the underlying legislation is flawed. In particular, the Dutch case shows that privacy is a crucial element in smart metering legislation. Energy consumption reveals details of personal life, in the most privacy-sensitive place the home, and therefore smart metering has to strike a careful balance between detailed energy metering and privacy protection. In this paper, we present the recent developments in smart metering and describe the Dutch case in detail. From this, we draw key lessons for countries that want to introduce smart metering. In terms of substance, the level of detail of smart meter readings and the mandatory or voluntary character of smart meters are crucial issues to take into account. Legislators must make a trade-off between the “smartness” of the meter versus a comprehensive, mandatory roll-out. In terms of procedure, a privacy impact assessment is vital, and pitfalls of function creep should be avoided by resisting the temptation of making a meter “too smart” all at once. From the outset, privacy and data protection law must be taken into account as an important requirement for the design of smart metering systems. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.

AB  - Cloud computing (CC) has the potential to provide significant benefits to healthcare organizations; however, its susceptibility to security and privacy apprehensions needs to be addressed before its adoption. It is important to evaluate the risks that arise from CC prior to its adoption in healthcare projects. Failure to evaluate security and privacy concerns could result in regulatory penalties, reputation loss, financial issues, and public loss of confidence in the healthcare provider. This paper uses Alberta’s Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) requirement and COBIT 5 for Risk as guidance to highlight CC risk assessment areas and presents an IT governance and risk mitigation approach useful for CC adoption in the healthcare industry. In compliance with Alberta’s Health Information Act (HIA), the risk assessment areas are analyzed based on the security triad with emphasis on the confidentiality principle where privacy is the main focus. The proposed approach presented in this paper can be utilized by healthcare providers to mitigate and continuously evaluate CC risks from an IT governance perspective. Although the case study uses Canadian regulations, similar considerations can be taken into account in other jurisdictions. © 2017, Institut Mines-Télécom and Springer-Verlag France.

AB  - Upcoming years will see a massive deployment of electric vehicles and, combined with this, of charging infrastructure. This will require protocols and standards that will control authentication, authorization, and billing of electric-vehicle charging. The ISO/IEC 15118 protocol that addresses the communication between the charging station and the vehicle is going to play an important role, at least in Europe. While it foresees security protection, there are no significant mechanisms for privacy protection in place. In this paper, we investigate the privacy protection of ISO/IEC 15118 and the surrounding charging and payment infrastructure by means of a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA). Based on this we propose modular extensions of the protocol applying state-of-the-art Privacy Enhancing Technologies like anonymous credentials to come to a system with maximum privacy protection. We conducted a second PIA to show the benefits to privacy protection that our POPCORN protocol provides compared to the original ISO/IEC 15118. We also describe a proof-of-concept implementation of our system based on a model of electric vehicle and charging station that shows the feasibility of our approach and allows a first preliminary analysis of performance and other issues. © 2013 ACM.

AB  - In this paper we analyze the issues surrounding the European Proposal for General Data Protection Regulation and the adaptation of law to the technical capabilities that have an impact on privacy. We start by analyzing the new capabilities of robotic machines and the involvement of new stakeholders as engineers, designers and manufacturers. Then we present the challenges of M2M relationships and the risks of being detected through devices. Next, we discuss the need to incorporate some concepts such as ‘pseudonym”, anonymous processing and legal profiling. We also argue that law needs technical standards and we foresee that engineers, designers and manufacturers will not have a neutral role. Future regulation should ensure some guidelines for privacy safe robots, and guarantee privacy and freedom in a technological world. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.

AB  - Personal data is sensitive information asset primarily needed to be protected. In order to protect personal data, privacy-protected rules, designs, guidelines, and legal arrangements have been developed so far. Especially, Privacy Impact Assessment methods have been developed with a growing interest in European countries. However, developing information technologies leave these studies insufficient. In this work, a new feature based Privacy Impact Assessment method is proposed for the purpose of protection of personal data. This study focuses on evaluating the privacy impact of data set at attribute level instead of evaluating all of the data which is a general approach to protect data. With the help of calculation at feature level, more sensitive and private personal data parts can be defined and hidden. Data homogeneity method is preferred for privacy impact evaluation calculations. The outcome of this work is data items grouped by privacy impact. According to our proposal, more homogeneous data is more sensitive and its privacy is important. The proposed method is tested on two different data set and the obtained results are analyzed. The most important finding of our work is that attributes that do not appear to be private can be private after combining attributes.

AB  - Unidirectional social media applications encompass a range of applications, often referred to as applets or widgets,1 that allow users to view relevant, real-time content from predetermined sources.2 The Department of Homeland Security (DHS or Department) intends to use unidirectional social media tools including desktop widgets, mobile apps,3 podcasts,4 audio and video streams,5 Short Message Service (SMS) texting,6 and Really Simple Syndication7 (RSS) feeds, among others, for external relations (communications and outreach) and to disseminate timely content to the public about DHS initiatives, public safety, and other official activities and one-way notifications. These dynamic communication tools broaden the Department's ability to disseminate content and provide the public multiple channels to receive and view content. The public will continue to have the option of obtaining comparable content and services through the Department's official websites and other official means. This Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) analyzes the Department's use of unidirectional social media applications. This PIA does not cover users sending content to the Department. Additionally, this PIA will describe the personally identifiable information (PII) and the extremely limited circumstances that the Department will have access to PII, how it will use the PII, what PII is retained and shared, and how individuals can gain access to their PII. Appendix A of this PIA will serve as a listing, to be updated periodically, of DHS unidirectional social media applications, approved by the Chief Privacy Officer, that follow the requirements and analytical understanding outlined in this PIA.8 The unidirectional social media applications listed in Appendix A are subject to Privacy Compliance Reviews by the DHS Privacy Office. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - The new E.U. proposal for a general data protection regulation has been introduced to give an answer to the challenges of the evolving digital environment. In some cases, these expectations could be disappointed, since the proposal is still based on the traditional main pillars of the last generation of data protection laws. In the field of consumer data protection, these pillars are the purpose specification principle, the use limitation principle and the "notice and consent" model. Nevertheless, the complexity of data processing, the power of modern analytics and the "transformative" use of personal information drastically limit the awareness of consumers, their capability to evaluate the various consequences of their choices and to give a free and informed consent. To respond to the above, it is necessary to clarify the rationale of the "notice and consent" paradigm, looking back to its origins and assessing its effectiveness in a world of predictive analytics. From this perspective, the paper considers the historical evolution of data protection and how the fundamental issues coming from the technological and socio-economic contexts have been addressed by regulations. On the basis of this analysis, the author suggests a revision of the "notice and consent" model focused on the opt-in and proposes the adoption of a different approach when, such as in Big Data collection, the data subject cannot be totally aware of the tools of analysis and their potential output. For this reason, the author sustains the provision of a subset of rules for Big Data analytics, which is based on a multiple impact assessment of data processing, on a deeper level of control by data protection authorities, and on the different opt-out model. © 2014 Alessandro Mantelero.

AB  - † At the heart of a current global debate as to privacy regulation and 'Big Data' debate lie four questions: - Can national privacy laws and regulation facilitate socially beneficial uses and applications of Big Data while precluding 'Big Brother' or unduly 'spooky, 'creepy', or otherwise socially or culturally unacceptable Big Data practices? - Can diverse national privacy laws and regulation be applied or adapted so as to accommodate socially beneficial uses and applications of Big Data, or is a more fundamental overhaul of privacy law required? - If fundamental design precepts of privacy regulation require adaptation or supplementation to address Big Data, can those changes be made without threatening broader consistency and integrity of privacy protections for individuals? Can any adaptation or changes be made quickly enough to address growing citizen concerns about unacceptable or hidden Big Data practices? † Responsible governance of data analytics affecting citizens, whether by businesses or government, requires a new dialogue and community understanding about appropriate transparency and ethical boundaries to uses of data analytics. This requires both businesses and government to acknowledge that for many citizens, privacy still matters and that many citizens have a deficit of trust as to uses of their personal information by government and at least some businesses. † A nuanced debate about good Big Data and bad Big Data and transparency as to acceptable data analytics practices is necessary for a dialogue between citizens and data users. This paper examines how to build transparency and engender trust through good business practices in data analytics. † The paper considers developing regulatory policy concerning the de-identification of personal information and how to embed privacy impact assessment practices and privacy by design and security by design principles as operational (administrative, security, and contractual) safeguards within data analytics service providers, governments, and businesses. © The Author 2013.

AB  - A law in Japan has been established concerning the My Number system or the use of numbers for identifying specific individuals in administrative procedures in local governments. The law requires local governments to implement the specific personal implementation protection assessment for social security and tax number systems. In this paper, we analyzed the assessment reports of the specific personal information protection assessments conducted by local governments. We did the analysis in two directions: (1) adequacy of risk assessment and measures, and (2) reuse of the assessment report. Our analysis shows that there was a description of assessment on the risk assessment items, but there were many assessment reports with missing assessment on some operations. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2017.

AB  - Privacy, a fundamental human right, is a key nonfunctional requirement to every electronic service and applications designed for smart societies. Informational privacy, the right of individuals to control information related to them, in smart societies is at the core of this chapter. A key aspect in the layout of smart societies and smart cities is the understanding and prediction of human behavior, which is nowadays fundamentally based on collecting and processing personal data. Hence, smart societies need to accommodate individuals’ rights and the data collection needs. We provide an overview of the existing models and techniques for protecting individuals’ privacy, such as privacy policies, transparency tools and anonymous communication systems, and discuss the needs and limitations of Privacy by Design (PbD) in the layout of smart societies and Internet of Things. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017, corrected publication 2017.

AB  - This article presents the results of a study performed in 2013 for the United Kingdom (UK) Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) on improving the integration of a privacy impact assessment (PIA) with risk management and project management methodologies and making recommendations for the revision of the ICO's PIA Handbook. † The study included a large-scale survey of organizations' use of these methodologies and consonance with the Handbook; case studies based on in-depth interviews; and an analysis of methodologies with a view to their integration with PIA. † The main finding was that there are possibilities for integrating PIA into project and risk management practices. However, such integration would require some re-allocation and development of relevant roles, and the creation of a privacy-aware culture so that privacy risk can be assessed early enough in an organization's cycles to make a difference to the information systems, processes, and policies that are produced. † The study team made recommendations to the ICO and other organizations that use PIAs. The findings and recommendations have applicability not only to organizations in the UK, but in other countries as well. © The Authors 2014. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many threats and attacks have been found in online social networks. When a security incident happens and data loss occurs, it is important to assess how the lost data affects user privacy. Most approaches for privacy impact assessment are based on checklists and auditions. There is lack of quantitative analysis approach to study privacy impact. Privacy impact assessment is a very challenging issue. First, data loss includes direct data loss, indirect data loss, and potential data loss. The impact of these data loss to user privacy should all be considered. Second, privacy impact assessment requires measuring privacy. Privacy measurement itself is a challenging issue. Third, users are all connected in a social network. Data loss may spread and propagate across the whole social network. In this paper, we summarize issues and challenges for privacy impact assessment. We further propose a quantitative analysis approach to assess privacy impact for online social networks. Two particular challenges are considered in the paper, privacy impact assessment when partial user information is disclosed, and privacy impact assessment when a group of user accounts are compromised. The paper provides a quantitative analysis approach for government agencies, enterprises, and organizations to assess privacy impact for online social networks when a security incident occurs. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Purpose: Offshoring is a common practice to operationalize global business strategies. Data protection and privacy assurance are major concerns in such international arrangements. This paper aims to examine the strategy adopted to ensure privacy assurance in offshoring arrangements. Design/methodology/approach: This is a literature review to understand privacy assurance strategies adopted in offshoring arrangements and an exploratory case study of captive offshoring arrangement with onshore location in Canada and offshoring locations in India and Philippines. A comparative analysis of the privacy laws and privacy principles of Canada, Philippines and India has been done. Findings: It was found that at the time of migration of process or work to the offshore location, organizations follow a conformist privacy strategy; however, once in business as usual mode, they follow entrepreneur privacy strategy. Privacy impact assessment (PIA) was found to be an important element in resolving the “administrative problem” of an offshoring organization’s privacy assurance strategy. Research limitations/implications: The core privacy principles are outlined in the PIA templates; however, the current templates are designed to meet the conformist strategy and may need to be revised to include the cultural aspects, training, audit and information security requirements to plan and deliver on the entrepreneur strategy. Practical implications: Offshoring organizations can benefit by planning for entrepreneur privacy assurance strategy at the inception stage. Enhancements to PIA templates to facilitate the same have been suggested. Originality/value: Privacy assurance strategy followed by organizations while offshoring has been examined. This paper suggests extending the PIA process so that it covers privacy assurance requirements in offshoring arrangements. The learnings can be used in managing privacy assurance requirements in similar multi-country offshore arrangements. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The smart city project is currently being promoted in various countries around the world. It is intended to take advantage of personal information and more appropriate utilization of energy. Therefore, the existence of privacy issues has been noted. Since a specific discussion of privacy risks in the smart city project is premature, we discuss the privacy risks associated with advances in the standardization of the smart grid, whose technology is the core of the smart city. In this paper we verify the effectiveness of Privacy Impact Assessment, with reference to privacy risks in the smart city. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - In Sep. 2015, the Act on the Use of Numbers to Identify a Specific Individual in the Administrative Procedure was revised. It was decided to link personal numbers to deposit numbers of financial institutions. Currently, the Privacy Impact Assessment which is obliged to implement this law is required to implement safety control measures for the private sector. However, there is no system to conduct a risk assessment of the law. In the financial industry, which is a highly private sector of public nature, some privacy risk assessment is required because it has many individual numbers. In this paper, we propose a framework for privacy risk assessment on this law in the financial industry, using the privacy impact assessment prescribed as an international standard. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.

AB  - This is the Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) for an updated version of the EINSTEIN System. EINSTEIN is a computer network intrusion detection system (IDS) used to help protect federal executive agency information technology (IT) enterprises. Pursuant to Section 208 of the E-Government Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-347, 44 U.S.C. § 3501, note), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) must provide this publicly available PIA prior to initiating a new collection of information that uses information technology to collect, maintain or disseminate information that is in an identifiable form or collects identifiable information through the use of information technology. The original PIA for EINSTEIN 1, dated September 2004, explained that EINSTEIN 1 analyzes network flow information from participating federal executive government agencies and provides a high-level perspective from which to observe potential malicious activity in computer network traffic of participating agencies' computer networks. The updated version, EINSTEIN 2, will incorporate network intrusion detection technology capable of alerting the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) to the presence of malicious or potentially harmful computer network activity in federal executive agencies' network traffic. EINSTEIN 2 principally relies on commercially available intrusion detection capabilities to increase the situational awareness of the US-CERT. This network intrusion detection technology uses a set of predefined signatures based upon known malicious network traffic. The signatures which will be implemented when EINSTEIN 2 goes "live" are based upon malicious computer code and are not based upon personally identifiable information (PII). Nor is the IDS programmed to specifically collect or locate PII. While future signatures might be developed in response to threats that use what appears to be PII, the purpose of these signatures is to prevent malicious activity from reaching federal networks, not to collect or locate PII. For example, if the author of a computer security exploit chose to use PII in the delivery of malicious code, a signature may be developed in response to that exploit which could contain PII.1 Accordingly, while the IDS will collect some PII that is directly related to malicious code being transmitted to the federal networks, its main focus is to identify the malicious code and protect federal networks, not to collect PII. In identifying malicious code across the federal networks, EINSTEIN 2 increases situational awareness and provides an improved real-time ability to address computer network incidents on federal systems. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - The Smart City project is currently being promoted in various countries around the world. That is to take advantage of personal information and utilization of energy more appropriately. Therefore, it is said that when there are privacy issues. However, it specifically discuss the privacy risks in the specific project of Smart City is premature. We discuss the privacy risks around the smart grid standardization advances which technology is the core of the Smart City. In this paper, we have verified the effectiveness of the Privacy Impact Assessment, such as privacy risks in Smart City. © 2013 The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

AB  - Today’s IT applications involving the processing of personal data of customers are becoming increasingly complex. This complexity drives the probability of privacy breaches. Considerable damage to a company’s reputation and financial standing may ensue. Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) aim to systematically approach and reduce privacy risks caused by IT applications. Data protection authorities and the European Commission promote using PIAs in application design to help attaining ‘privacy by design’ right from the inception of a new IT application. To help companies developing IT applications with conducting PIAs, many open-source tools are available online (GS1 tool, iPIA tool, SPIA tool etc.). Although these tools are modular and well structured, they fail to provide a metric to comparing progress in the implementation of privacy controls. In general, most of the tools use qualitative scoring for privacy risk, through which the measurement of progress is difficult. To address these shortcomings of existing tools, this paper presents a structured scoring methodology for privacy risk. A three-step semi-quantitative approach is used to calculate a relative score, which enables the comparison of privacy risks between incremental versions of an IT application. This comparison enables the monitoring of progress and thus, makes PIAs more relevant for the companies. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2016.

AB  - Provenance data can be expressed as a graph with links informing who and which activities created, used and modified entities. The semantics of these links and domain specific reasoning can support the inference of additional information about the elements in the graph. If such elements include personal identifiers and/or personal identifiable information, then inferences may reveal unexpected links between elements, thus exposing personal data beyond an individual's intentions. Provenance graphs often entangle data relating to multiple individuals. It is therefore a challenge to protect personal data from unintended disclosure in provenance graphs. In this paper, we provide a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) template for identifying imminent privacy threats that arise from provenance graphs in an application-agnostic setting. The PIA template identifies privacy threats, lists potential countermeasures, helps to manage personal data protection risks, and maintains compliance with privacy data protection laws and regulations. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - This Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) examines the privacy implications of the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team's (US-CERT's) EINSTEIN Program in accordance with Section 208 of the E-Government Act and the guidance for PIAs issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). This PIA addresses for the EINSTEIN Program: - What and why the information is being collected; - The intended use of the agency information; - With whom the information will be shared; - What notice or opportunities for consent would be provided to individuals regarding information collected; - How that information is shared and secured; and - Whether a system of records is being created under section 552a of title 5, United States Code (the -Privacy Act"). • The EINSTEIN Program is an automated process for collecting, correlating, analyzing, and sharing computer security information across the Federal civilian government. By collecting information from participating Federal government agencies, the US-CERT builds and enhances our nation's cyber-related situational awareness. Awareness will facilitate identifying and responding to cyber threats and attacks, improve network security, increase the resiliency of critical, electronically delivered government services, and enhance the survivability of the Internet. • The US-CERT has prepared the EINSTEIN Program to implement statutory and administrative responsibilities in two distinct, but related areas. - First, in accordance with the mandate of the Homeland Security Act, as well as of Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) through the US-CERT will deploy the EINSTEIN Program to help protect cyberspace. - Second, in accordance with the Federal Information Security Management Act (-FISMA?), the EINSTEIN Program supports Federal agencies in their efforts to comply with Congressional requirements for information security, including compliance with information assurance guidelines prepared by OMB. The EINSTEIN Program provides an essential layer of protection for the Federal Enterprise Architecture (-FEA?) and the IT infrastructure used to deliver essential citizen services. There are no other cross-agency, automated processes that support FISMA compliance, protect the FEA, and focus on delivery of essential government services. • In this manner, the EINSTEIN Program supports Federal agencies' efforts to protect their computer networks. System and network administrators within each agency are responsible for guarding access to sensitive information and computing infrastructure. During the past several years, network attacks and disruptions have become increasingly common and occur at rates that prevent government officials from managing risks effectively without a collective and collaborative information-sharing program. Bothstatutory provisions and the Office of Management and Budget require agencies to share incident and risk data with the US-CERT to accomplish these goals. • Federal agency partners are the core of the EINSTEIN Program's capability. Each Federal agency administrator retains complete control of network data in strict accordance with Federal laws and polices. Agencies gather and subsequently share security data directly with the US-CERT, based on reporting requirements established by OMB. In turn, the US-CERT prepares a strategic, cross-agency assessment, which is then shared back with all Federal civilian agencies. Federal civilian agencies are -- in return for sharing anomaly and security data -- better positioned to protect their systems, save scarce resources, and provide essential services. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Innovations in emerging technologies have an impact on privacy and fundamental rights. For example, emerging technologies include future biometric systems for crime prevention. In contrast to large-scale biometric systems for migration control, these systems promise to track down terrorists and organized criminals but also entail novel risks for society. One can govern science and technology by means of privacy impact assessments (which are currently being researched). Alternatively there is the approach - used in this paper - that primarily builds on the assumption that technology design can render the violation of a legal norm impossible. Using German and European constitutional law as an example, this paper will present proposals for technology design derived from the law. © 2013 Copyright ICCR Foundation.

AB  - The protection of privacy is predicated on the individual's right to privacy and stipulates a number of principles that are primarily focused on information privacy or data protection and, as such, are insufficient to apply to other types of privacy and to the protection of other entities beyond the individual. This article identifies additional privacy principles that would apply to other types of privacy and would enhance the consideration of risks or harms to the individual, to groups and to society as a whole if they are violated. They also relate to the way privacy impact assessment (PIA) may be conducted. There are important reasons for generating consideration of and debate about these principles. First, they help to recalibrate a focus in Europe on data protection to the relative neglect of other types of privacy. Second, it is of critical importance at a time when PIA (renamed ‘data protection impact assessment’, or DPIA) may become mandatory under the European Commission's proposed Data Protection Regulation. Such assessment is an important instrument for identifying and mitigating privacy risks, but should address all types of privacy. Third, one can construct an indicative table identifying harms or risks to these additional privacy principles, which can serve as an important tool or instrument for a broader PIA to address other types of privacy. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Smart grids offer novel means of energy governance and promise an adequate response to environmental, societal and technical developments of the 21st century. At the same time, they are capable of invading the sacrosanctity of the most privacy-sensitive place - the home. This chapter sketches several societal challenges that smart grids pose, and amongst these the threat of abusive surveillance practices. The "light" regulatory approach that the European Union has taken as a response is subsequently overviewed and critically assessed. We argue that this approach and its core element, i.e. a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) framework, is rather a missed opportunity. We conclude that impact assessments of emerging technologies must be inclusive, easy to use and flexible, satisfying certain quality criteria. © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Privacy by Design (PbD) is a kind of precautionary legal technology design. It takes opportunities for fundamental rights without creating risks for them. Now the EU Commission "promised" to implement PbD with Art. 23(4) of its proposal of a General Data Protection Regulation. It suggests setting up a committee that can define technical standards for PbD. However the Commission did not keep its promise. Should it be left to the IT security experts who sit in the committee but do not have the legal expertise, to decide on our privacy or, by using overly detailed specifications, to prevent businesses from marketing innovative products? This paper asserts that the Commission's implementation of PbD is not acceptable as it stands and makes positive contributions for the work of a future PbD committee so that the Commission can keep its promise to introduce precautionary legal technology design. © 2012 Baker and McKenzie LLP.

AB  - PriCal is an ambient calendar display that shows a user's schedule similar to a paper wall calendar. PriCal provides context-adaptive privacy to users by detecting present persons and adapting event visibility according to the user's privacy preferences. We present a detailed privacy impact assessment of our system, which provides insights on how to leverage context to enhance privacy without being intrusive. PriCal is based on a decentralized architecture and supports the detection of registered users as well as unknown persons. In a three-week deployment study with seven displays, ten participants used PriCal in their real work environment with their own digital calendars. Our results provide qualitative insights on the implications, acceptance, and utility of contextadaptive privacy in the context of a calendar display system, indicating that it is a viable approach to mitigate privacy implications in ubicomp applications.

AB  - Societal impact assessment (SIA) refers to a set of guidelines and principles to identify the societal effects of new technologies, programs, and projects. Starting in the domain of environmental issues, SIA has expanded into other areas where new technologies start to shape the everyday life of citizens. With a strong focus on participatory and anticipatory strategies, SIA attempts to establish a broader understanding of technology taking into account the perspective of different stakeholders. This article briefly reviews key elements of SIA and then discusses its potential, using privacy impact assessment as a test case. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) National Cyber Security Division (NCSD) launched the EINSTEIN program in 2004 as a computer network intrusion detection system to help protect federal executive agency information technology enterprises. NCSD deployed EINSTEIN in phases including EINSTEIN 1, EINSTEIN 2, and the Initiative 3 Exercise (Exercise), with each phase adding new functionality. The first phase, EINSTEIN 1 was launched in 2004 and serves as an automated process for collecting computer network security information from voluntarily participating federal executive agencies. EINSTEIN 1 collects network flow records,1 which identify the source Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer that connects to the federal system; the port the source uses to communicate; the time the communication occurred; the federal destination IP address; the protocol used to communicate; and, the destination port. EINSTEIN 2, launched in 2008, incorporates network intrusion detection that monitors for malicious activity in network traffic to and from participating federal executive agencies. This gives the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) 2 the ability to analyze malicious activity occurring across the federal IT networks resulting in improved computer network security into the basic platform of the EINSTEIN program capabilities. This network intrusion detection technology uses a set of custom signatures3 based upon known malicious network traffic. Each new level of EINSTEIN builds on the previous one but EINSTEIN 1 and 2 continue to operate as distinct programs as new capabilities are introduced to later versions. In 2010, NCSD launched the Exercise to identify the ability of an existing Internet Service Provider to select and redirect internet traffic from a single participating government agency through the Exercise technology. The Exercise applied intrusion detection and prevention measures to that traffic and allowed for US-CERT to generate automated alerts about selected cyber threats. As the EINSTEIN program progresses EINSTEIN 1, 2 and eventually 3 will continue to work to prevent cyber threats from attacking the federal system and increase cybersecurity. NCSD conducted Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) for each phase of the EINSTEIN program, which the DHS Privacy Office reviewed and approved. As NCSD looks ahead toward the next phase of the program to EINSTEIN 3, the DHS Privacy Office determined that conducting a Privacy Compliance Review (PCR) would be timely to ensure the accuracy of compliance documentation and transparency of the EINSTEIN program moving forward.4 The primary objective of the PCR was to assess NCSD's compliance with existing privacy compliance documentation, specifically the EINSTEIN 2 (May 19, 2008) and Initiative 3 Exercise (March 18, 2010) PIAs.5 To address our objective, the DHS Privacy Office reviewed Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), Concept of Operations for National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS) - which includes EINSTEIN capabilities, international agreements, and signature templates. The DHS Privacy Office also held a question and answer session with NPPD/NCSD leadership, conducted two visits of the US-CERT analyst site, and interviewed US-CERT analysts who use, have access to, and are responsible for the accuracy of EINSTEIN program capabilities. The review was conducted from May to July 2011 and was led by the DHS and NPPD Privacy Offices. Throughout the review, the DHS Privacy Office collaborated with the leadership of NPPD and NCSD including the: former US-CERT Director; Acting USCERT Director; US-CERT Deputy Chief of Operations; Network Security Deployment, System Sustainment and Operations Section Chief; and Director, Network Security Deployment. NPPD/NCSD recently hired a senior privacy analyst to work on privacy protections and issues for the EINSTEIN program. This review occurred before the analyst could be fully integrated into the general practices of NCSD. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pursuant to Initiative Three of the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative, DHS is engaging in an exercise to demonstrate a suite of technologies that could be included in the next generation of the Department's EINSTEIN network security program. This demonstration, (commonly referred to as the -Initiative Three Exercise" or, more simply, as ?the Exercise") will use a modified complement of system components currently providing the EINSTEIN 1 and EINSTEIN 2 capabilities, as well as a DHS test deployment of technology developed by the National Security Agency (NSA) that includes an intrusion prevention capability (collectively referred to as -the Exercise technology"). The purpose of the Exercise is to demonstrate the ability of an existing Internet Service Provider that is a designated as a Trusted Internet Connection Access Provider (TICAP) to select and redirect Internet traffic from a single participating government agency through the Exercise technology, for US-CERT to apply intrusion detection and prevention measures to that traffic and for US-CERT to generate automated alerts about selected cyber threats. This PIA is being conducted because the Exercise will analyze Internet traffic which may contain personally identifiable information (PII). © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - The use of privacy protection measures is of particular importance for existing and upcoming users’ digital identities. Thus, the recently adopted EU Regulation on Electronic identification and trust services (eIDAS) explicitly allows the use of pseudonyms in the context of eID systems, without specifying how they should be implemented. The paper contributes to the discussion on pseudonyms and multiple identities, by (1) providing an original analysis grid that can be applied for privacy evaluation in any eID architecture, and (2) introducing the concept of eID deployer allowing virtually any case of the relationship between the user, the eID implementation and the user’s digital identities to be modelled. Based on these inputs, a comparative analysis of four exemplary eID architectures deployed in European countries is conducted. The paper also discusses how sensitive citizens of these countries are to the privacy argument while adopting these systems, and presents the “privacy adoption paradox”. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2015.

AB  - This paper aims to propose regulatory recommendations for IoT smart-health care service, by using the method of Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA). We utilize data from a relevant IoT smart-health care project in Indonesia. On structuring the final regulatory recommendations, we have conducted in-depth interview to the stake holders of Indonesian IoT smart-health care service. The results show that there are 5 aspects that need to be set in the proposed regulations, i.e. security compliance, device security, secure communications, virtualization security, and application security. In each of that aspect, we have built specific recommendation to ensure IoT service provider giving the best service without decreasing comfort of private information protection. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Any reasonable implementation of privacy requirements can not be made through legal compliance alone. The belief that a software system can be developed without privacy being an integral concept, or that a privacy policy is sufficient as requirements or compliance check is at best dangerous for the users, customers and business involved. While requirements frameworks exist, the specialisation of these into the privacy domain have not been made in such a manner that they unify both the legal and engineering domains. In order to achieve this one must develop ontological structures to aid communication between these domains, provide a commonly acceptable semantics and a framework by which requirements expressed at different levels of abstractness can be linked together and support refinement. An effect of this is to almost completely remove the terms 'personal data' and 'PII' from common usage and force a deeper understanding of the data and information being processed. Once such a structure is in place - even if just partially or sparsely populated - provides a formal framework by which not only requirements can be obtained, their application (or not) be justified and a proper risk analysis made. This has further advantages in that privacy requirements and their potential implementations can be explored through the software development process and support ideas such as agile methods and 'DevOps' rather than being an 'add-on' exercise - a privacy impact assessment - poorly executed at inappropriate times. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - The existing paradigms governing the management of personal data globally are under pressure from rapid technological and social change. This article examines recent proposals for modernizing information privacy law in the USA, the European Union, Australia and New Zealand. It finds significant areas of commonality and critically explores points of difference, notably innovations such as the de-coupling of previously linked privacy principles, dichotomies between consumer-facing companies and third parties and new rights such as the right to be forgotten and to erasure, the right to data portability, privacy by design and default and privacy impact assessment. The article argues that the proposals ought to draw on each other's strengths. © The Author (2013). Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - The IoT is innovative and important phenomenon prone to several services ad applications, but it should consider the legal issues related to the data protection law. However, should be taken into account the legal issues related to the data protection and privacy law. Technological solutions are welcome, but it is necessary, before developing applications, to consider the risks which we cannot dismiss. Personal data is a value. In this context is fundamental to evaluate the legal issues and prevent them, adopting in each project the privacy by design approach. Regarding the privacy and security risks, there are some issues with potential consequences for data security and liability. The IoT system allows us to transfer data on the Internet, including personal data. In this context, it is important to consider the new European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - already in force from 24 May 2016 - that will be applicable on 25 May 2018. The GDPR introduces Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), data breach notification and very hard administrative fines in respect of infringements of the Regulation. A correct law analysis allows evaluating risks preventing the wrong use of personal data. The IoT ecosystem is evolving quickly, developing several applications in different sectors. The main topics for the last time are Big Data and the blockchain. People are paying attention to the latest one because of its potential concrete use for services and applications, increasing the security measures to guarantee a secure system. However, it is equally important to analyse the legal issues related to them. Everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her. In this context, we cannot dismiss to guarantee an adequate protection of personal data designing any application. The contribution describes the main legal issues related to privacy and data protection especially regarding the blockchain, focusing on the Privacy by Design approach, according to the GDPR. Furthermore, I resolutely believe that is possible to develop a worldwide privacy standard framework that organisations can use for their data protection activities. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Purpose: Privacy impact assessments (PIAs) are an important tool for managing risk in both public and private sector projects. The best evidence of how PIAs are being conducted is the PIA reports published at the conclusion of the process. This paper aims to consider PIA reports from five countries and assesses their strengths, weaknesses and impacts. Design/methodology/approach: The paper also identifies key trends and makes recommendations for improving the PIA process and enabling access to lessons learned by PIA practitioners. Findings: The paper calls for further study of PIA case studies to determine how closely practitioners and assessors follow the PIA methodologies promulgated in their countries, to seek good practice in the preparation of PIAs and for the creation of a central repository for PIAs. Originality/value: The author believes this is the first such paper to review actual PIA reports. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - The increasing demand from individuals to have their privacy respected or to take decisions about the management of their information assumes a significant role in business activities and it becomes an important element for building public trust in service providers. † In this scenario, keeping the focus of data protection only on the individual and his or her decisions is no longer adequate. If legislators consider data protection as a fundamental right, it is necessary to reinforce its protection in order to make it effective and not conditioned by the asymmetries which characterize the relationship between data subject and data controllers. † This aim is implemented by the EU proposal by means of three different instruments: data protection impact assessment, privacy by design/by default solutions, and the data minimization principle. † The competitive value of data protection can be assured and enhanced only if the user's self-determination over personal data is guaranteed. From this point of view, countering the phenomena of data lock-in and 'social' lock-in is fundamental in order to offer privacy-oriented and trustworthy services, which increase user propensity to share data and stimulate the digital economy and fair competition. © The Author 2013.

AB  - This paper posits that ethical dilemma scenarios are a useful instrument to provoke policy-makers and other stakeholders, to including industry, in considering the privacy, ethical, social and other implications of new and emerging technologies. It describes a methodology for constructing and deconstructing such scenarios and provides four such scenarios in an orthogonal relationship with each other. The paper describes some different, but closely related scenario construction-deconstruction methodologies, which formed the basis for the methodology adopted in the European Commission-funded PRESCIENT project. The paper makes the point that in ethical dilemma scenarios, it is not immediately apparent what choices policy-makers should select. Hence, there is a need for undertaking a privacy and ethical impact assessment and engaging stakeholders in the process to identify and discuss the issues raised in the scenarios. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This paper explores the European Commission's proposal for a new Regulation to update and reform data protection law in Europe. As regards the Regulation itself, without presenting an exhaustive analysis of all the provisions, this paper aims to highlight some significant changes proposed to the data protection regime by comparison between Directive 95/46 and the proposed Regulation. It takes particularly into account legislative innovation concerning data protection principles, data subjects' rights, data controllers and data processors obligations, and the regulation of technologies. Before analyzing these innovations, it introduces some considerations about the Commission's choice to use a Regulation instead of a Directive to harmonize national data protection regime. © 2012 Baker and McKenzie LLP.

AB  - Recent controversies surrounding privacy have sparked a move by regulators toward the idea of privacy by design (PbD), a concept pioneered by Ontario Information and Privacy Commissioner Ann Cavoukian. Industry has also started to recognize the importance of taking privacy seriously, with various PbD corporate initiatives currently underway. However, some commentators have criticized PbD for being too vague. Using three case studies and a range of best practice examples of PbD, privacy impact assessments (PIAs), and privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs), this article addresses the gap between the abstract principles of PbD and their operationalization into more concrete implementation guidelines for software engineers. © 2014, Published with license by Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to lay the groundwork for the creation of a composite indicator of the validity of regulatory systems. The composite nature of the indicator implies a) that its construction is embedded in the long-standing theoretical debate and framework of legal validity; b) that it formally contains other sub-indicators whose occurrence is essential to the determination of validity. The paper suggests, in other words, that validity is a second-degree property, i.e., one that occurs only once the justice, efficiency, effectiveness, and enforceability of the system have been checked. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.

AB  - Personally Identifiable Information (PII) includes any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother's maiden name, or biometric records. It also includes other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information. PII is often the target of attacks, and loss of PII could result in identity theft. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, the average number of U.S. identity fraud victims annually is 11,571,900 [1]. The total financial loss attributed to identity theft in 2013 was $21 billion dollars, compared to $13.2 billion total loss in 2010 [1]. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - The IoT is innovative and important phenomenon prone to several services and applications, but it should consider the legal issues related to the data protection law. However, should be taken into account the legal issues related to the data protection and privacy law. Technological solutions are welcome, but it is necessary, before developing applications, to consider the risks which we cannot dismiss. Personal data is a value. In this context it is fundamental to evaluate the legal issues and prevent them, adopting in each project the privacy by design approach. Regarding the privacy and security risks, there are some issues with potential consequences for data and liability. The IoT system allows us to transfer data on the Internet, including personal data. In this context, it is important to consider the new European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that will be in force on 25 May 2018. The GDPR introduces Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), data breach notification and very hard administrative fines in respect of infringements of the Regulation. A correct law analysis allows evaluating risks preventing the wrong use of personal data. The contribution describes the main legal issues related to privacy and data protection focusing on the Privacy by Design approach, according to the GDPR. Furthermore, I resolutely believe that is possible to develop a global privacy standard framework that organisations can use for their data protection activities. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - New and emerging technologies often raise both ethical and privacy issues. The analysis and assessment of such issues is the task of privacy impact assessments and ethical impact assessments. Although there are various privacy impact assessment methodologies and ethical impact assessment methodologies, the two have not been integrated. Nevertheless, some researchers have been thinking about the utility and feasibility of integrating privacy and ethical impact assessment methodologies. © The Author 2013.

AB  - We propose a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) method based on successive questionnaires for an initial screening and for a full screening for a given project. These were tailored to satisfy the needs of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) that intend to process personal data in the cloud. The approach is based on legal and socio-economic analysis of privacy issues for cloud deployments and takes into consideration the new requirements for DPIAs within the European Union (EU) as put forward by the proposed General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The resultant features have been implemented within a tool. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - As cloud computing becomes a widely used technology, it is essential to provide mechanisms and tools that enable trust about how personal data is dealt with by cloud providers. The Cloud Accountability (A4Cloud) project tries to solve the problem of ensuring trust in the cloud by providing tools that support the process of achieving accountability. In this paper we will concentrate on some specific tools that were demonstrated and discussed during the A4Cloud workshop held in association with the IFIP Privacy Summer School in Edinburgh in 2015. In particular, we will describe tools that facilitate the appropriate choice of a cloud provider such as the Cloud Offerings Advisory Tool (COAT) and the Data Protection Impact Assessment Tool (DPIAT), tools that are in charge of controlling the data of the users such as the Data Track (DT) tool, and tools that help specify and enforce accountability related policies by using the Accountability-Primelife Policy Language (A-PPL) and an associated enforcement engine. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2016.

AB  - For companies that develop and operate IT applications that process the personal data of customers and employees, a major problem is protecting these data and preventing privacy breaches. Failure to adequately address this problem can result in considerable damage to the company's reputation and finances, as well as negative effects for customers or employees (data subjects). To address this problem, we propose a methodology that systematically considers privacy issues by using a step-by-step privacy impact assessment (PIA). Existing PIA approaches cannot be applied easily because they are improperly structured or imprecise and lengthy. We argue that companies that employ our PIA can achieve 'privacy-by-design', which is widely heralded by data protection authorities. In fact, the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) ratified the approach we present in this article for the technical field of RFID and published it as a guideline in November 2011. The contribution of the artefacts we created is twofold: First, we provide a formal problem representation structure for the analysis of privacy requirements. Second, we reduce the complexity of the privacy regulation landscape for practitioners who need to make privacy management decisions for their IT applications. © 2014 Operational Research Society Ltd.

AB  - Privacy impact assessments (PIAs) are emerging as an important privacy management tool for public and private sector organizations. However, a key concern of PIA policy and practice is the lack of follow-up and means to evaluate its conduct at different levels, particularly so that different stakeholders can make sense of PIA practice as evidenced in PIA reports. This article first outlines the evaluation criteria established under the EU Privacy Impact Assessment Framework project and attempts to find the best means of extending their application to help assess PIAs, based on good practice. © 2013 Copyright ICCR Foundation.

AB  - Nowadays, data processing components are often part of a multitude of products and services. The current review of the European data protection framework, is proposing the replacement of the Data Protection Directive with a Regulation, which will undoubtedly impact the development of such products and services. This chapter analyses some of the critical changes proposed in the Regulation, highlighting the developments with regard to the actual scope of application of the European legal framework, the consent of the users and the particularities of processing pseudonymous data. It also critically assesses the proposed obligations relating to data security, notification of personal data breaches, the principles of data protection by design and by default, as well as data protection impact assessments. The authors conclude that these changes may actually be a step in the direction of more privacy-aware development of products and applications that entail data processing operations, if certain modalities are taken into account before the final adoption of the draft Regulation. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2014.

AB  - This paper focuses on the assessment of ethical, legal and social issues (ELSI) in relation to agile information systems in the domain of crisis management. The authors analyse the differing needs of a move from a traditional approach to the development of information systems to an agile approach, which offers flexibility, adaptability and responds to the needs of users as the system develops. In turn, the authors argue that this development requires greater flexibility and an iterative approach to assessing ELSI. The authors provide an example from the Horizon 2020 EU-funded project iTRACK (Integrated system for real-time TRACKing and collective intelligence in civilian humanitarian missions) to exemplify this move to an iterative approach in practice, drawing on the process of undertaking an ethical and privacy impact assessment for the purpose of this project.

AB  - Data protection authorities worldwide have agreed on the value of considering privacy-by-design principles when developing privacy-friendly systems and software. However, on the technical plane, a profusion of privacy-oriented guidelines and approaches coexists, which provides partial solutions to the overall problem and AIDS engineers during different stages of the system development lifecycle. As a result, engineers find difficult to understand what they should do to make their systems abide by privacy by design, thus hindering the adoption of privacy engineering practices. This paper reviews existing best practices in the analysis and design stages of the system development lifecycle, introduces a systematic methodology for privacy engineering that merges and integrates them, leveraging their best features whilst addressing their weak points, and describes its alignment with current standardization efforts. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Health IT is the use of Information Technology (IT) in healthcare to improve patients' experience, enable quality care, efficiency, speed, and security of the collection, exchange, sharing, and storage of sensitive personal information. But Health IT faces a number of notable challenges ranging from privacy risks to trust and confidence in the use of EHRs. In this chapter, a framework for conducting Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) of Health IT projects is discussed. Privacy impact assessment is a process through which privacy risks are assessed. The chapter includes recommendations for mitigating identified risks and ensuring compliance to policy and processes for handling and processing of highly sensitive and Personally Identifiable Information (PII). © 2016, IGI Global.

AB  - Owing to digitization of information and e-commerce, various sectors like public, financial and private sectors are using a great number of personal information, and incidents caused by sensitive information leakage tend to be increased everyday. Though a privacy impact assessment system was introduced to prevent security problems of personal information, it has been hard to operate it. It is necessarily suggested to have much easier privacy impact assessment support system. This thesis suggests PIAMS(Privacy Impact Assessment Management System) which is needed in public and private sectors. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Privacy legislation addresses concerns regarding the privacy of personal information; however, its interpretation by research ethics boards has resulted in significant challenges to the collection, management, use and disclosure of personal health information for multi-centre research studies. This paper describes the strategy used to develop the national Rick Hansen Spinal Cord Injury Registry (RHSCIR) in accordance with privacy statutes and benchmarked against best practices. An analysis of the regional and national privacy legislation was conducted to determine the requirements for each of the 31 local RHSCIR sites and the national RHSCIR office. A national privacy and security framework was created for RHSCIR that includes a governance structure, standard operating procedures, training processes, physical and technical security and privacy impact assessments. The framework meets a high-water mark in ensuring privacy and security of personal health information nationally and may assist in the development of other national or international research initiatives.

AB  - The proposal for a new European Data Protection Regulation introduces the novel obligation of performing data protection assessments. Since these assessments will become a mandatory exercise for those in control of data processing systems, they will become an important apparatus for the governance of new and emerging information technologies. This tool, and in particular the notion of "risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects" which is at its core, epitomises the shift from classical legal practice to more risk-based approaches. Merging risks and rights in the proposed fashion could change their meanings into something hardly predictable. This contribution proposes to explore the nature of the relation between both concepts within the assessment of a "risk to a right". It will start by mapping out the various relations that exist between risks and rights in different practices. This should serve to identify gaps in the way DPIAs are currently operationalised and might well determine whether the introduction of this methodology in its current form might itself pose a risk to the rights of privacy and data protection. In turn however, it can provide opportunities for improvement and for lessons to be drawn from other practices and expertise that strike different relations between risks and rights, like the ones found in environmental governance and courts. © 2015 Niels van Dijk, Raphal Gellert and Kjetil Rommetveit.

AB  - Privacy-aware software development is gaining more and more importance for nearly all information systems that are developed nowadays. As a tool to force organizations and companies to consider privacy properly during the planning and the execution of their projects, some governments advise to perform privacy impact assessments (PIAs). During a PIA, a report has to be created that summarizes the consequence on privacy the project may have and how the organization or company addresses these consequences. As basis for a PIA, it has to be documented which personal data is collected, processed, stored, and shared with others in the context of the project. Obtaining this information is a difficult task that is not yet well supported by existing methods. In this paper, we present a method based on the problem-based privacy analysis (ProPAn) that helps to elicit the needed information for a PIA systematically from a given set of functional requirements. Our tool supported method shall reduce the effort that has to be spent to elicit the information needed to conduct a PIA in a way that the information is as complete and consistent as possible. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - In this paper, we describe a privacy filter proposed for the Visual Privacy Task (VPT) 2013, as a case study to validate the efficacy of the User-Intimate Requirements and Evaluation Methodology (UI-REF). This comprises an automated objective evaluation phase supported by a subjective user study to cross-validate and complement the results of the objective assessment. The performance of the proposed filter, as well as the overall performance trends and tradeoffs of the alternative filtering techniques are highlighted. The results demonstrated the consistency and high resolution evaluation capabilities of the Holistic Evaluation Framework for Privacy by Co-Design and Impact Assessment for benchmarking privacy filtering solutions.

AB  - In the public debate, social implications of information technology are mainly seen through the privacy lens. Impact assessments of information technology are also often limited to privacy impact assessments, which are focused on individual rights and well-being, as opposed to the social environment. In this article, I argue that this perspective is too narrow, in terms of understanding the complexity of the relation between information technology and society, as well as in terms of directions for managing this relation. I use systems theory to show that current approaches focus mostly on individual impact of information technology developments rather than their mediating role in society itself. I argue that this should be complemented by an analysis of impact on individuals (psychic systems) via co-construction of the environment (social system). I then take up the question of what the role of information technology in social systems would look like in terms of the social relations of trust and power, and how this can complement privacy in discussions on impacts of information technology. © 2017, Published with license by Taylor & Francis © 2017, © Wolter Pieters.

AB  - The European Commission is revising the EU's data protection framework. One of the changes concerns privacy impact assessment (PIA). This paper argues that the European Commission and the EU Member States should draw on the experience of other countries that have adopted PIA policies and methodologies to construct its own framework. There are similarities and differences in the approaches of Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the UK and US, the countries with the most experience in PIA. Each has its strong points, but also shortcomings. Audits have identified some of the latter in the instance of Canada. This paper provides a comparative analysis of the six countries to identify some of the best elements that could be used to improve Article 33 in European Commission's proposed Data Protection Regulation.

AB  - Privacy by design' is not only important from an economic perspective but also from a legal one. The upcoming European General Data Protection Regulation makes privacy by design and default mandatory. One concrete step an organisation can take towards privacy by design is to perform a privacy impact assessment. To verify the assumption that the outcome of the assessment leads to sufficient and adequate input for designing privacy-friendly products and systems that comply with privacy regulations and social norms regarding privacy we performed a descriptive field study in the Netherlands. In this paper, we present the results of this study. Our main results are the following. When performing a privacy impact assessment, organisations use the organisation itself as a focal point, instead of the data subjects whose data is being processed. The proposed countermeasures tend to address the effect rather than the cause of a privacy risk. A consequence of this focus is that the outcome of the privacy impact assessment will lead, at best, to a product or system that is compliant with data protection regulation. It will not lead to a product or system that is privacy-friendly, or one that takes into account social norms regarding the processing of personal information. Another significant result is that the data protection officers who were interviewed perceive the process of determining privacy risks, based on the information gathered about a specific product or system, as vague. Further research is needed to develop a more rigorous and transparent process for determining privacy risks that can be used by organisations.

AB  - Background/Objectives: The occurrence of privacy issues arising in the course of collecting the sensitive personal information for the purpose of the provision of wellness care services as a stumbling block to the commercialization of such services. Methods/Statistical analysis: The study will define the main agents by drawing up a flowchart which will show by personal information life cycle the flow of the collection, retention, and utilization/provision of the PWR(Personal Wellness Record) on the platform. In addition, the study will draw out legal measures and infringement risks based on the flow of personal information and present relevant personal information protection measures. Findings: The PWR are sensitive information about individuals’ health, body, and psychology, and they involve a serious concern about privacy breach when collected. In addition, since the platforms such as IoT devices, Database/Web Server, and mobile application themselves have security weaknesses, countermeasures against the occurrence of hacking and infringement incidents are needed in order to protect personal information. This study presented a research method for solving privacy and information security issues by using the cases of the wellness care platform. An application of the derived personal information security measures to the platform is expected to help solve the problems of the utilization and protection of the personal information in the future wellness care platform and contribute to the market revitalization. Improvements/Applications: This study presented a solution for the utilization and the protection of personal information using PIA focusing on the cases of the forest healing-based u-wellness care platform. © RJPT All right reserved.

AB  - Privacy Impact Assessments (PIA) are increasingly used and, in certain jurisdictions, legally mandated in projects to foresee risks to privacy and to plan strategies to avoid these. Once adopted and implemented, the EU's Data Protection Regulation will, in certain circumstances require the need for a PIA. This short paper focuses upon the PIA process in an EU-funded project to develop cloud-based disaster response technology. It introduces the project and then gives a background to the PIA process. Insights and observations are then made on how the PIA operates, with the aim of drawing conclusions that can both improve the current project and be transferable to others.

AB  - Over the last 20 years or so, a range of new policy instruments has entered the '‘toolbox’’ of those regulators charged with implementing and enforcing information privacy and data protection policy. During the earlier history of these policies, it was generally assumed that law alone, codifying the information privacy principles and establishing independent oversight, would be both necessary and sufficient to regulate the collection, use and dissemination of personal data by organisations. The assumptions have shifted. Now, it is generally assumed that law is necessary, but not sufficient. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.

AB  - Privacy impact assessment (PIA) can be used to investigate the impact upon privacy that surveillance, using new information and communications technologies (ICTs) or information systems, might have before these applications are fully developed and implemented. PIA requires that an organisation subject its plans to more or less rigorous screening through the lens of privacy or data protection, to identify weaknesses in the innovation’s compliance with relevant laws or principles, and to indicate how these might be eliminated. Myriad stakeholders potentially affected by the innovation may also be involved in this investigation. In an extreme situation, a project could be abandoned if its PIA indicated irremediable shortcomings. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.

AB  - The adoption of PIAs in the UK is a recent development. Both it, and related initiatives such as '‘privacy by design’', pioneered by the Ontario Information and Privacy Commissioner, Ann Cavoukian1 (discussed further below), can be seen as indicative of a disenchantment amongst some regulators, including the UK’s national data protection regulator, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), with the largely reactive approach to regulation adopted by the EU Data Protection Directive and the national legislation which implements it. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.

AB  - Canadian government bodies are subject to a number of requirements, including legislation, regulations, directives and policies, that speaks to informational privacy. These have come to be considered synonymous with the completion of a Privacy Impact Assessment. Some go so far as to specifically require an assessment, but few speak to specific technical content. Nor are there process requirements for sustaining privacy standards once the assessment document is submitted. At best, recommendations are identified to enhance the privacy posture of a program area's information management practices, but there is no mechanism to ensure that they are implemented. We propose the PIA process be adapted to mandate privacy outcomes in terms of specific actions that must be taken once the assessment is complete. Starting with the established PIA document, the program area can identify how to best marry the privacy requirements with the established business processes supporting the service delivery line. The result would incorporate privacy outcomes as ongoing activities and include not only consideration of agency requirements for personal information management, but also the impact to an individual's informational privacy. © 2008 Crown Copyright.

AB  - In December 2006, a new computer-based screening program called Automated Targeting System (ATS), deployed by the US to screen international travelers at all air, land and sea borders, became the subject of public discussion. ATS was developed for the specific purpose of screening cargo and container shipments into US ports, assigning a risk score to all imports in advance of their arrival at the border. As the Department of Homeland Security’s Privacy Impact Assessment for ATS states, the risk assessments enable the ‘‘identification of previously unknown areas of note, concern or pattern’’ (2006: 9). The system for identifying ‘‘unknown’’ threats in mobile goods and objects has now been exported in full to the risk management of mobile people at US borders. ATS analyzes a variety of passenger data – including address, financial records, ‘‘no show’’ history, how tickets were purchased, motor vehicle records, past one-way travel and seating preference – in order to assign a risk score to individual travelers. The score is used to determine whether passengers or border crossers are placed on a ‘‘selectee list’’ for further attention, stopped and questioned at the border or, indeed, denied entry. The risk assessment calculation in ATS is classified, and the results can be kept on file for up to forty years (Sniffen 2006). Civil liberties groups voiced objection to the program. According to Barry Steinhardt of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), ATS casts suspicion on millions of innocent travelers, while seriously threatening privacy and constitutional liberties. While the system explicitly seeks to make visible an unknown person who would not otherwise be seen, assigning a risk value to every recoverable life transaction, the risk calculation itself is never made visible. Because the system screens the entire population of travelers in the search for the ‘‘unknown terrorist,’’ people can never meaningfully access, challenge or correct their risk category. One of Steinhardt’s concerns is the absence of limits to the data authorities may want to access for security screening. ‘‘Does the government get to scrutinize every address at which you’ve ever lived?’’ wonders Steinhardt (2007), ‘‘Quiz you about the fact that you once went for 12 months without a job? About your web surfing, your online book purchases, your school transcripts . . . your associations?’’ However, Stewart Baker (2006) of the Department of Homeland Security asserts that ATS has been successful in turning back individuals who pose a high security risk while offering ‘‘faster service for most travelers.’’ Baker reveals that the most important feature of ATS is its ability to do ‘‘a quick link analysis’’ that checks travelers against terrorism watch lists, so being able to identify, for example, ‘‘travelers who gave the airline a phone number that’s also used by a known terrorist.’’ Baker concludes by emphasizing the need to connect the dots of available data, suggesting that data analysis may have prevented 9/11: This is a lesson we learned from September 11. After-the-fact reviews of the hijackers’ travel reservations showed that we might have been able to uncover the plot if we’d had better computer systems and better access to travel data . . . We didn’t connect those dots before 9/11, but we should have. We learned that lesson, and now ATS allows us to look for these links. © 2008 Louise Amoore and Marieke de Goede, selection and editorial matter.

AB  - In July 2007, the UK Information Commissioner's Office commissioned a team of researchers, coordinated by Loughborough University, to conduct a study into Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs). This was with a view to developing PIA guidance for the UK. The project resulted in two key deliverables: a study of the use of PIAs in other jurisdictions, identifying lessons to be learnt for the UK; and a handbook that can be used to guide organisations through the PIA process, taking into account the provisions of the UK Data Protection Act (DPA) 1998. This paper draws on the original research undertaken as part of that assignment to provide an overview of the ICO-funded project and the extent to which PIAs can be used in the current UK context. Firstly, the authors consider the findings of the comparative study and how the UK experience can be informed by developments overseas. Secondly, the paper outlines the development of the handbook during the course of the project and the extent to which it has been influenced by the overseas experience and the current UK political context. Thirdly, aspects of the handbook itself are considered and explained. Particular attention is paid to: its format; its key features; and feedback received on an interim version from a focus group of experienced data protection and project management practitioners. Finally, the paper concludes by stating why the study and the handbook provide appropriate tools for guidance in the current UK context, and how they can be developed further. © 2008 Adam Warren, Robin Bayley, Andrew Charlesworth, Colin Bennett, Roger Clarke, Charles Oppenheim.

AB  - Ubiquitous computing is characterized by the merger of physical and virtual worlds as physical artifacts gain digital sensing, processing, and communication capabilities. Maintaining an appropriate level of privacy in the face of such complex and often highly dynamic systems is challenging. We argue that context awareness not only enables novel Ubi- Comp applications but can also support dynamic regulation and configuration of privacy mechanisms. We propose a higher level context model that abstracts from low level details and contains only privacy relevant context features. Context changes in our model can trigger reconfiguration of privacy mechanisms or facilitate context-specific privacy recommendations to the user. Based on our model, we analyze potential privacy implications of context changes and discuss how these results could inform actual reconfiguration of privacy mechanisms. Copyright 2012 ACM.

AB  - Forensic Science is gaining more importance in criminal justice, since the development of new sensitive and accurate scientific tools, and the construction of large computerized databases. Although very effective, these databases pose a lot of legislative and ethical concerns. In case of DNA concerns are deeper since it contains sensitive genetic information regarding its owner, not necessarily needed for his identification. This paper focuses on issues related to the collection, utilization and retention of DNA samples and profiles of legally innocent populations, illustrated by a case study where a voluntarily given DNA sample for a murder investigation successfully solved three non related rape cases.

AB  - Pursuant to Initiative Three of the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative, DHS is engaging in an exercise to demonstrate a suite of technologies that could be included in the next generation of the Department’s EINSTEIN network security program. This demonstration, (commonly referred to as the “Initiative Three Exercise” or, more simply, as “the Exercise”) will use a modified complement of system components currently providing the EINSTEIN 1 and EINSTEIN 2 capabilities, as well as a DHS test deployment of technology developed by the National Security Agency (NSA) that includes an intrusion prevention capability (collectively referred to as “the Exercise technology”). The purpose of the Exercise is to demonstrate the ability of an existing Internet Service Provider that is a designated as a Trusted Internet Connection Access Provider (TICAP) to select and redirect Internet traffic from a single participating government agency through the Exercise technology, for US-CERT to apply intrusion detection and prevention measures to that traffic and for US-CERT to generate automated alerts about selected cyber threats. This PIA is being conducted because the Exercise will analyze Internet traffic which may contain personally identifiable information (PII). © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - New applications for Radio Frequency Identifi-cation (RFID) technology include embedding transponders in everyday things used by individuals, such as books, payment cards, and personal identification. While RFID technology has existed for decades, these new applications carry with them substantial new privacy and security risks for individuals. These risks arise due to a combination of aspects involved in these applications: 1) The transponders are permanently embedded in objects individuals commonly carry with them 2) Static data linkable to an individual is stored on these transponders 3) The objects these transponders are embedded in are used in public places where individuals have limited control over who can access data on the transponder. In 2002, the U.S. Department of State proposed the adoption of an "electronic passport," which embedded RFID transponders into U.S. passports for identification and document security purposes. In this paper, we use the U.S. Government's adoption process for the electronic passport as a case study for identifying the privacy and security risks that arise by embedding RFID technology in "everyday things." We discuss the reasons why the Department of State did not adequately identify and address these privacy and security risks, even after the government's process mandated a privacy impact assessment. We conclude with recommendations to assist government as well as industry in early identification and resolution of relevant risks posed by RFID technology embedded in everyday things. © 2007 IEEE.

AB  - This research adopts a grounded theory approach to examine the drivers, safeguards and operational outcomes of organizational information privacy responses in the healthcare context. Semi-structured interviews with key healthcare stakeholders were conducted. The findings are sobering. First, privacy safeguards are driven by legal compliance, competitive advantages, available resources and best practices. However, organizations have to balance conflicting risks associated with these drivers. Second, this study identifies the operational and behavioral outcomes which results in major balance issues. Third, the adoption of a privacy impact assessment (PIA) allows the integration of a risk management approach to effectively assess the different types of privacy risks. The findings provide evidence for: (1) a gap between privacy responses and their outcomes on healthcare practice and delivery; (2) the importance of the privacy impact assessment as a risk management tool; and (3) the challenging context of the healthcare environment of how privacy responses are unfolding.

AB  - Privacy impact assessment (PIA) is a systematic process for evaluating the potential effects on privacy of a project, initiative or proposed system or scheme. Its use has become progressively more common from the mid-1990s onwards. On the one hand, privacy oversight agencies and privacy advocates see PIAs as an antidote to the serious privacy-intrusiveness of business processes in the public and private sectors and the ravages of rapidly developing information technologies. On the other, governments and business enterprises alike have struggled to encourage public acceptance and adoption of technologies that are very apparently privacy-invasive, and have been turning to PIAs as a means of understanding concerns and mitigating business risks. This paper distinguishes PIAs from other business processes, such as privacy issues analysis, privacy law compliance checking and privacy audit, and identifies key aspects of the development of PIA practice and policy from their beginnings through to the end of 2008. © 2009 Xamax Consultancy Pty Ltd.

AB  - If privacy is a cornerstone of democracy,1 then democracy is in trouble. Especially since the advent of the computer, the encroachments on privacy have proliferated. Terrorist attacks in the early 21st century have given governments all the justifications they need to bolster national security by forcing telecom companies to retain telephone records, to justify warrantless eavesdropping on our phone calls, to examine our bank records, to fuse personally identifiable information from multiple sources, to profile citizens to determine who presents a risk to the established order. Many companies have either aided and abetted governmental efforts or engaged in their own surreptitious amassing of the details of our lives. Personal data in real time has become the fuel of today’s economy. © 2012, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Privacy impact assessment can be a tool for responsible research and innovation (RRI). RRI can be defined as a transparent, interactive process by which societal actors and innovators become mutually responsive to each other. In order to allow a proper embedding of scientific and technological advances in society, actors and innovators keep in mind ethical acceptability, sustainability, and societal desirability of the innovation process and its marketable products [1]. This definition of RRI is close to the definition of privacy impact assessment (PIA). PIA is a process of engaging stakeholders to consider the impact of a new technology, product, service, project, or policy on privacy, and what measures could be taken to avoid or mitigate unwanted effects. © 2006 IEEE.

AB  - A major problem for companies that develop and operate IT applications that process personal data of customers and employees is to ensure the protection of this data and to prevent privacy breaches. Failure to adequately address this problem can result in considerable reputational and financial damages for the company as well as for affected data subjects. We address this problem by proposing a methodology to systematically consider privacy issues in a step-by-step privacy impact assessment (so called 'PIA'). Existing PIA approaches lack easy applicability because they are either insufficiently structured or imprecise and lengthy. We argue that employing the PIA proposed in this article, companies will be enabled to realise a 'privacy-by-design' as it is now widely heralded by data protection authorities. In fact, the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) ratified the approach we present in this article for the technical field of RFID and published it as a guideline in November 2011. The contribution of the artefacts we created is twofold: First, we provide a formal problem representation structure for the analysis of privacy requirements. Second, we reduce the complexity of the privacy regulation landscape for practitioners who need to make privacy management decisions for their IT applications.

AB  - In early 2007, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC) embarked on a project to measure the extent to which privacy issues arising from government operations were being appropriately managed. The audit, titled Assessing the Privacy Impacts of Programs, Plans and Policies, was the first of its kind in Canada and, to the best of our knowledge, the only comprehensive evaluation of the implementation of privacy impact assessments (PIAs) worldwide. It was an important initiative, not only for its findings – many of which can be applied crossjurisdictionally – but also for its salutary effects on PIA practices government-wide. While the primary objective of the audit was to assess compliance with the government’s policy on PIAs, it has served as importantly to promote an understanding of PIAs as an effective risk management tool. © 2012, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - This paper argues for a reconceptualisation of the notion of "privacy" due to the impact that new and emerging technologies (many of them being information and communication technologies) are having. The existing conceptual and legal framework was shaped in a time that was radically different from the networked society in which we live today. The values to be protected, however, remain generally accepted. Thus it is necessary to reflect what privacy will mean in the future and how it can be more effectively being protected. The authors argue in favour of a privacy impact assessment framework, perhaps one that also factored in ethical considerations. © 2010 IADIS.

AB  - The challenges organisations face in managing privacy risks are numerous, and inherently diverse. Traditionally, organisations focused on addressing business and security requirements of a project, but most recently, privacy impact assessment has become an essential part of the risk management regime for most projects. Significant efforts are now directed toward providing appropriate guidance on how to conduct privacy impact assessments. Appropriate assessments of privacy invasive technologies, justification for project, collection and handling of personally identifiable data and compliance to privacy legislations possess enormous challenges to carrying out appropriate privacy impact assessments. In this chapter, guidance on how to assess privacy risks of both new and in-service projects is provided. Further, lessons learned from managing privacy risks of new and in-service projects resulting from aggregation, collection, sharing, handling and transportation of personally identifiable information are discussed. © 2012, IGI Global.

AB  - Privacy in health information system is important to ensure the confidentiality of sensitive and personal information belongs to individual remain intact. There are numerous cases of unauthorised intrusions of personal health information occurred but no legal action can be exerted due to the absence of a privacy act in Malaysia. Therefore, a preliminary observation has been conducted to review the current privacy implementations in management of personal health information at Malaysian government hospitals. Analysis was conducted based on OECD Fair Information Practices Guideline which has been the benchmark of most of the privacy and data protection legislation in the world. Interviews were conducted with key personnel in medical informatics and legal expertise using Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) technique as guidance. The findings of the observation were then compared with the existing health information privacy acts. Then, recommendations were made to include those findings in the proposed privacy law or policy in Malaysia. © 2010 International Business Information Management Association.

AB  - The transport sector is a natural focal point for surveillance measures to combat the threat of terrorism. It is also a complex environment that offers many examples of the social impacts of contemporary surveillance. Surveillance needs to be assessed against the standards used to justify other forms of security measures. The efficacy of many surveillance schemes, however, is in serious doubt. Justification for these schemes is commonly either lacking entirely or is unpublished and hence has not been subjected to critical evaluation. A small set of mini-cases is presented, in order to identify the social impacts of twenty-first century surveillance schemes that have been implemented as fear-driven responses to terrorist acts. Those impacts are argued to be seriously harmful to society. Trust is crucial to public acceptance of intrusive measures, but the absence of justification for surveillance, and of controls over abuses, is likely to see the rapid dissipation of trust, firstly in the assertions of national security and law enforcement agencies, and secondly in the politicians who have been rubber-stamping their demands.

AB  - † Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) have become mainstream in many jurisdictions since the mid-1990s. † Considerable experience has been gained, and the features of effective PIA processes are capable of being described and communicated. † A range of guidance documents have been published, but they vary considerably in their quality. † This paper draws on the literature and the author's professional experience in order to present a list of criteria whereby the quality of a PIA guidance document can be judged. It then applies the criteria to a dozen documents published by government agencies in ten jurisdictions. † Several guidance documents are found to be of high quality, but several others have significant weaknesses and the remainder describe processes that are so deficient that the appropriateness of referring to them as PIAs is in serious doubt. © The Author 2011.

AB  - It is important to analyse the privacy impact of Intrusion Detection System (IDS) rules, in order to understand and quantify the privacy-invasiveness of network monitoring services. The objective in this paper is to classify Snort rules according to the risk of privacy violations in the form of leaking sensitive or confidential material. The classification is based on a ruleset that formerly has been manually categorised according to our PRIvacy LEakage (PRILE) methodology. Such information can be useful both for privacy impact assessments and automated tests for detecting privacy violations. Information about potentially privacy violating rules can subsequently be used to tune the IDS rule sets, with the objective to minimise the expected amount of data privacy violations during normal operation. The paper suggests some classification tasks that can be useful both to improve the PRILE methodology and for privacy violation evaluation tools. Finally, two selected classification tasks are analysed by using a Naïve Bayes classifier. © 2010 IEEE.

AB  - The precautionary principle - which implies that where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing protective measures - has been adopted as a standard of environmental and health protection in international and European legislation. This article offers an overview of the precautionary principle as a legal standard applicable to European privacy and data protection legislation. For this reason, it takes particularly into account the guidelines of this legislation as well as the privacy impact assessment framework, raised by the European Commission through the Recommendation on Radio-Frequency Identification applications. In brief, the article stresses the role of the precautionary principle in improving privacy protection through liability, prudence and transparency. © 2012 Luiz Costa. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to develop/elaborate the concept Privacy by Design (PbD) and to explore the validity of the PbD framework. Design/methodology/approach: Attention for alternative concepts, such as PbD, which might offer surplus value in safeguarding privacy, is growing. Using PbD to design for privacy in ICT systems is still rather underexplored and requires substantial conceptual and empirical work to be done. The methodology includes conceptual analysis, empirical validation (focus groups and interviews) and technological testing (a technical demonstrator was build). Findings: A holistic PbD approach can offer surplus value in better safeguarding of privacy without losing functional requirements. However, the implementation is not easily realised and confronted with several difficulties such as: potential lack of economic incentives, legacy systems, lack of adoption of trust of end-users and consumers in PbD. Originality/value: The article brings together/incorporates several contemporary insights on privacy protection and privacy by design and develops/presents a holistic framework for Privacy by Design framework consisting of five building blocks. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - The centerpiece of the federal government's legal framework for privacy protection, the Privacy Act of 1974, provides safeguards for information maintained by federal agencies. In addition, the E-Government Act of 2002 requires federal agencies to conduct privacy impact assessments for systems or collections containing personal information. The author was asked to determine whether laws and guidance consistently cover the federal government's collection and use of personal information and incorporate key privacy principles. The author was also asked, in doing so, to identify options for addressing these issues. © 2009 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - New applications for Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology include embedding transponders in everyday things used by individuals, such as library books, payment cards, and personal identification cards and documents. While RFID technology has existed for decades, these new applications carry with them substantial new privacy and security risks for individuals. These risks arise due to a combination of aspects involved in these applications: 1) The transponders are permanently embedded in objects individuals commonly carry with them 2) Static data linkable to an individual is stored on these transponders 3) The objects these transponders are embedded in are used in public places where individuals have limited control over who can access data on the transponder. In 2002, the U.S. Department of State proposed the adoption of an "electronic passport," which embedded RFID transpondersinto U.S. passports for identification and document security purposes. In this paper, we use the U.S. Government's adoption process for the electronic passport as a case study for identifying the privacy and security risks that arise by embedding RFID technology in everyday things. We discuss the reasons why the Department of State did not adequately identify and address these privacy and security risks, even after the government's process mandated a privacy impact assessment. We present recommendations to assist government as well as industry in early identification and resolution of relevant risks posed by RFID technology embedded in everyday things. We show how these risks exists with many new and upcoming applications of embedded RFID in everyday things and how these applications can benefit from the recommendations for a more secure and privacy preserving design. © 2007 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.

AB  - There is growing interest in Europe in privacy impact assessment (PIA). The UK introduced the first PIA methodology in Europe in 2007, and Ireland followed in 2010. PIAs provide a way to detect potential privacy problems, take precautions and build tailored safeguards before, not after, the organisation makes heavy investments in the development of a new technology, service or product. This paper presents some findings from the Privacy Impact Assessment Framework (PIAF) project and, in particular, the project's first deliverable, which analyses the similarities and differences between PIA methodologies in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States, with a view to picking out the best elements which could be used in constructing an optimised PIA methodology for Europe. The project, which began in January 2011, is being undertaken for the European Commission's Directorate General Justice. The first deliverable was completed in September. The paper provides some background on privacy impact assessment, identifies some of its benefits and discusses elements that can be used in construction of a state-of-the-art PIA methodology. © 2011 David Wright.

AB  - The adoption of PIAs in the UK is a recent development. Both it, and related initiatives such as “privacy by design”, pioneered by the Ontario Information and Privacy Commissioner, Ann Cavoukian1 (discussed further below), can be seen as indicative of a disenchantment amongst some regulators, including the UK’s national data protection regulator, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), with the largely reactive approach to regulation adopted by the EU Data Protection Directive and the national legislation which implements it. © 2012, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - If privacy is a cornerstone of democracy,1 then democracy is in trouble. Especially since the advent of the computer, the encroachments on privacy have proliferated. Terrorist attacks in the early 21st century have given governments all the justifications they need to bolster national security by forcing telecom companies to retain telephone records, to justify warrantless eavesdropping on our phone calls, to examine our bank records, to fuse personally identifiable information from multiple sources, to profile citizens to determine who presents a risk to the established order. Many companies have either aided and abetted governmental efforts or engaged in their own surreptitious amassing of the details of our lives. Personal data in real time has become the fuel of today’s economy. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.

AB  - Why are tools needed to build privacy into business processes? As in most endeavors, tools can help, and in an application area where, for example, privacy may be resisted in favor of the fallacious argument of higher profits, tools are needed. Most professionals have heard of the Privacy Impact Assessment (Warren et al., 2008). This is a tool that evaluates the impact to privacy of a proposed change to business practice. Prior to the introduction of this tool, such impacts to privacy were either done in an ineffective way or not even considered. Privacy Protection Measures and Technologies in Business Organizations: Aspects and Standards is a collection of research on privacy protection technologies and their application in business organizations. Providing insights and support professionals concerned with the management of expertise, knowledge, information, and organizational development in different types of business organizations and environments. This book will be composed of professionals and researchers working in the field of privacy protection in various disciplines. © 2012 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: To foster the development of a privacyprotective, sustainable cross-border information system in the framework of a European public health project. Materials and methods: A targeted privacy impact assessment was implemented to identify the best architecture for a European information system for diabetes directly tapping into clinical registries. Four steps were used to provide input to software designers and developers: a structured literature search, analysis of data flow scenarios or options, creation of an ad hoc questionnaire and conduction of a Delphi procedure. Results: The literature search identified a core set of relevant papers on privacy (n=11). Technicians envisaged three candidate system architectures, with associated data flows, to source an information flow questionnaire that was submitted to the Delphi panel for the selection of the best architecture. A detailed scheme envisaging an "aggregation by group of patients" was finally chosen, based upon the exchange of finely tuned summary tables. Conclusions: Public health information systems should be carefully engineered only after a clear strategy for privacy protection has been planned, to avoid breaching current regulations and future concerns and to optimise the development of statistical routines. The BIRO (Best Information Through Regional Outcomes) project delivers a specific method of privacy impact assessment that can be conveniently used in similar situations across Europe.

AB  - As the need to finance and sustain our valuable infrastructure grows and matures, more and more countries are turning to tolling and road user charging paradigms in their transport policy. The age-old "user-pays" approach provides an equitable and fair means to charge for the actual use of our infrastructure and provide a funding mechanism that endures. When toll roads multiply into network tolling and access is charged for our urban centers, the collection of charging data also implies the collection of personal data and the safeguarding of that information. This paper will begin by touching briefly on the meaning of privacy since this term is at times used interchangeably with confidentiality and security. But let me assure you that these are not one and the same. While privacy may subsume what is implied by confidentiality, it is a much broader concept involving the right to be free from intrusions, to remain autonomous, and to control the circulation of information about oneself.

AB  - Surveillance is becoming ubiquitous in our society. We can also see the emergence of "smart" surveillance technologies and the assemblages (or combinations) of such technologies, supposedly to combat crime and terrorism, but in fact used for a variety of purposes, many of which are intrusive upon the privacy of law-abiding citizens. Following the dark days of 9/11, security and surveillance became paramount. More recently, in Europe, there has been a policy commitment to restore privacy to centre stage. This paper examines the legal tools available to ensure that privacy and personal data protection are respected in attempts to ensure the security of our society, and finds that improvements are needed in our legal and regulatory framework if privacy is indeed to be respected by law enforcement authorities and intelligence agencies. It then goes on to argue that privacy impact assessments should be used to sort out the necessity and proportionality of security and surveillance programmes and policies vis - vis privacy. © 2010 Hogan Lovells.

AB  - This panel will address current and proposed solutions to navigating network data sharing restrictions discussed by the prior panel. The underlying dynamics which prevent or impede research access to network data are similar across several data-sharing regimes related to networked infrastructure vulnerabilities. We hope to engage technologists, policy makers, researchers and legal professionals across industry, government, law enforcement and academia as we discuss how to balance the interests of: ̇ Network researchers pursuing knowledge that will inform business models and communications policies, ̇ Network users seeking the benefits of technology advancement without having to surrender control of personal information, ̇ Network/platform owners exercising their rights to design and protect intellectual property, infrastructure, and business and customer relationships. The intended outcome of this panel is to help raise the level of discourse surrounding network data sharing, to inform and instigate actionable solutions that effectively balance the interests of these stakeholders. The following discussion questions will help frame the conversation: Copyright is held by the author/owner(s). NDA'08, October 31, 2008, Fairfax, Virginia, USA. ACM 978-1-60558-301-3/08/10. ̇ What are the economic, social and cultural incentives to sharing data and how do we leverage law and technology to create or improve them? ̇ What are the costs involved in sharing network data? How can those costs be reallocated? ̇ What is the role of technologies (code) and law (contract, regulation, case law) in striking a balanced solution? ̇ Is it necessary to revise current laws to protect network research interests, or can we more efficiently and effectively undertake more informal routes, i.e., privacy impact assessments, resolutions by authoritative bodies (ICANN, IETF, ACM, Internet2), reliance on third party trusted intermediaries? ̇ Can we construct a framework to guide risk analysis as well as the design and implementation of policies and mechanisms to address the trust and privacy issues that hamper data sharing? What are the essential capabilities of such a framework, e.g., auditability, certification, enforcement, negotiation, validation, informed consent, redressability? ̇ What mechanisms prevent abuse of authority regarding the shared data, i.e., provable compliance thru audit, privacy forensics; anonymization; filtering? How do we develop consensus on levels of confidence in these mechanisms? How do we protect the integrity of the shared data and enable trust to promote adoption and efficiency in sharing arrangements? ̇ How does the network research community generate collective action to steward its interests and inform policy? How does the community articulate its interests to influence the debate, i.e., via legislation, lobbying, etc.?

AB  - In the ubiquitous age, privacy will be the matter of trade-offs about pros and cons of revealing personal information for personalized services. Ubiquitous computing demands a fundamental shift in the control of personal information and requires disclosure of personal information. As we enjoy comfortable life, the invasion of personal information can be occurred at the same time. The privacy requires the effective security, but the effective security does not guarantee the effective privacy. We present the privacy engineering in order to prevent the privacy invasion and measure the economic value of privacy. We hope this privacy engineering in ubiComp will be used as one of the tool for protecting the users in the ubiquitous age. The approach includes the followings; the architecture of the privacy engineering, the database modeling, the privacy impact assessment, the economic value assessment of the privacy. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.

AB  - This paper traces the impact of six major RFID-relevant events in Europe since May 2009. It outlines the findings relevant to RFID and privacy in healthcare as published in the June 2009 RAND report and relates them to subsequent developments including the explicit inclusion in November 2009 of RFID in the E-Privacy Directive of 2002. The paper focuses on the process of implementation of the European Commission's May 2009 Recommendation of Privacy and RFID and especially the implications for healthcare providers in the form of the new requirement (in Europe) for Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs). The paper indicates three main areas of concern highlighted by the July 2010 Opinion of the EU's Art 29 Working Party which may be relevant to healthcare providers considering deployment of RFID. Following a comparison with the situation obtaining in North America, the paper concludes that PIAs will form part of the likely scenario for legal requirements or at the very least impact the actual design of RFID deployed in the healthcare sector in both Europe and North America. © 2010/2011-IOS Press and the authors.

AB  - Privacy is receiving increased attention from both consumers, who are concerned about how they are being tracked and profiled, and regulators, who are introducing stronger penalties and encouragements for organizations to comply with legislation and to carry out Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs). These concerns are strengthened as usage of internet services, cloud computing and social networking spread. Therefore companies have to take privacy requirements into account just as they previously had to do this for security. While security mechanisms are relatively mature, system and product developers are not often provided with concrete suggestions from a privacy angle. This can be a problem because developers do not usually possess privacy expertise. In this paper we argue that it would be useful to move beyond current best practice - where a set of searchable privacy guidelines may be provided to developers - to automated support to software developers in early phases of software development. Specifically, our proposal is a decision support system for design for privacy focused on privacy by policy, to be integrated into the development environment. We have implemented a proof of concept and are extending this work to incorporate state-of-the art consent mechanisms derived from the EnCoRe (Ensuring Consent and Revocation) project [1]. © 2011 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.

AB  - This is the Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) for an updated version of the EINSTEIN System. EINSTEIN is a computer network intrusion detection system (IDS) used to help protect federal executive agency information technology (IT) enterprises. Pursuant to Section 208 of the EGovernment Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-347, 44 U.S.C. § 3501, note), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) must provide this publicly available PIA prior to initiating a new collection of information that uses information technology to collect, maintain or disseminate information that is in an identifiable form or collects identifiable information through the use of information technology. The original PIA for EINSTEIN 1, dated September 2004, explained that EINSTEIN 1 analyzes network flow information from participating federal executive government agencies and provides a high-level perspective from which to observe potential malicious activity in computer network traffic of participating agencies’ computer networks. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - The development and deployment of new information and communications technologies and applications fuelled by the use of personal information may raise not only privacy concerns, but also ethical issues. In this chapter, we propose and describe an ethical impact assessment framework (EIA), which could complement a privacy impact assessment. Indeed, the two forms of impact assessment could be carried out concurrently. Like a PIA, an EIA could be used as a way to ensure ethical implications are adequately examined by stakeholders before deployment so that mitigating measures can be taken as necessary. © 2012, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - This paper considers the emergence of Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs), and identifies key aspects of their development, concept, practice and policy from their beginnings through to the date of writing (May 2010). A PIA is a systematic process for evaluating the possible effects that a particular activity or proposal may have on an individual's privacy. It should focus on understanding the system, initiative or scheme, identifying, and mitigating adverse privacy impacts, and assisting decision makers in deciding whether or not the project should proceed and if so, in what form. The PIA should be properly distinguished from other business processes such as privacy issue analysis, privacy audits [1] and privacy law compliance checking [2] as these are applied to existing systems to ensure their continuing conformity with internal rules and external requirements. © 2010 Hewlett-Packard Development Company, L.P.

AB  - Over the last 20 years or so, a range of new policy instruments has entered the “toolbox” of those regulators charged with implementing and enforcing information privacy and data protection policy. During the earlier history of these policies, it was generally assumed that law alone, codifying the information privacy principles and establishing independent oversight, would be both necessary and sufficient to regulate the collection, use and dissemination of personal data by organisations. The assumptions have shifted. Now, it is generally assumed that law is necessary, but not sufficient. © 2012, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Security risk assessment identifies the threats to systems, while privacy risk assessment identifies data sensitivities in systems. The Security Quality Requirements Engineering (SQUARE) method is used to identify software security issues in the early stages of the development lifecycle. We propose combining the existing security risk assessment techniques in SQAURE with the Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) technique and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) to address the full spectrum of security and privacy risks. Our ultimate goal is to introduce a privacy requirements engineering method that uses steps of SQUARE for privacy instead of or in addition to security.

AB  - The New Zealand government has proposed an identity management system, to provide an effective and convenient alternative for citizens to access online government information and services. The proposed system is branded as "igovt", which offers two types of authentication services. The first service provides people and businesses with logon identities. The sec-ond service provides semi-anonymised identities to government agencies. Each semi-anonymised identity carries a strictly limited amount of information about a logon identity along with an assurance that it corresponds to a living New Zealand citizen or a registered business entity. The New Zealand government has carefully designed the system with clearly-articulated policy principles. It has also conducted several privacy impact assessments and public consultations. However, the New Zealand government has not published any security analyses for igovt, and we are not aware of any unpublished ones. In this paper, we propose a lightweight methodology for the elicitation of security requirements of a complex but incompletely unimplemented system, such as igovt. We illustrate the use of our methodology by developing preliminary security specifications for a portion of the igovt system. © 2009, Australian Computer Society, Inc.

AB  - Ubiquitous computing demands a fundamental shift in the control of personal in-formation. Ubiquitous computing requires disclosure of personal information. The technology infrastructure means the basic components of the IT society such as web servers, DB, N/W, personal information devices, etc. And they can flow the personal information through the society. Business application systems which collect, store, process and/or disclose personal information should be identified and categorized. The process map for personal in-formation handling should document the flow of data from collection through all paths, internal and external, including all processing points, access/display points and destruction points. At this level, risks to personal information can be better understood. In this paper, we present the information privacy engineering for constructing to prevent the privacy invasion and measuring the economic value of privacy. We hope this privacy engineering will be used as one of the tool for protecting the users in ubiquitous age. The approach includes the followings; The Privacy Protection in Network, The database modeling in UbiComp, The privacy impact assessment in UbiComp. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.

AB  - In an emergency there are many stages of Medical response. This paper focuses on the first response stage of an emergency medical incident, for example, a sporting accident. Today's Information Technology together with mobile devices now permits vital medical information regarding an individual to be available at the scene. Those first in attendance are often not medically trained. The literature shows the importance of appropriate first response in minimising harm and the significant investments being made to educate the public in this regard. It also highlights the privacy concerns that arise from the provision of sensitive health information in electronic form. The method utilised is a Privacy Impact Assessment to ascertain the suitability and compliance of the proposed technology. This approach follows the privacy guidelines specified by the Australian government to include information flow mapping, evaluation, compliance analysis, risk analysis and recommendations to management. The resultant output is a list of specific questions and a set of commendations and recommendations that are matched against the National Privacy Principles. The paper concludes that: the approach is both technical and pragmatically viable; it can meet all the reasonableness tests for privacy concerns; it can adopt standard security measures, and; it discusses its potential to be integrated into Personally Controlled Electronic Health Records. © 2012 The authors and IOS Press.

AB  - Privacy impact assessment (PIA) can be used to investigate the impact upon privacy that surveillance, using new information and communications technologies (ICTs) or information systems, might have before these applications are fully developed and implemented. PIA requires that an organisation subject its plans to more or less rigorous screening through the lens of privacy or data protection, to identify weaknesses in the innovation’s compliance with relevant laws or principles, and to indicate how these might be eliminated. Myriad stakeholders potentially affected by the innovation may also be involved in this investigation. In an extreme situation, a project could be abandoned if its PIA indicated irremediable shortcomings. © 2012, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The development and deployment of new information and communications technologies and applications fuelled by the use of personal information may raise not only privacy concerns, but also ethical issues. In this chapter, we propose and describe an ethical impact assessment framework (EIA), which could complement a privacy impact assessment. Indeed, the two forms of impact assessment could be carried out concurrently. Like a PIA, an EIA could be used as a way to ensure ethical implications are adequately examined by stakeholders before deployment so that mitigating measures can be taken as necessary. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.

AB  - Virtually all organisations collect, use, process and share personal data from their employees, customers and/or citizens. In doing so, they may be exposing themselves to risks, from threats and vulnerabilities, of that data being breached or compromised by negligent or wayward employees, hackers, the police, intelligence agencies or third-party service providers. A recent study by the Ponemon Institute found that 70 per cent of organisations surveyed had suffered a data breach in the previous year. Privacy impact assessment is a tool, a process, a methodology to identify, assess, mitigate or avoid privacy risks and, in collaboration with stakeholders, to identify solutions. Contributors to this book - privacy commissioners, academics, consultants, practitioners, industry representatives - are among the world’s leading PIA experts. They share their experience and offer their insights to the reader in the policy and practice of PIA in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the United States and elsewhere. This book, the first such on privacy impact assessment, will be of interest to any organisation that collects or uses personal data and, in particular, to regulators, policy-makers, privacy professionals, including privacy, security and information officials, consultants, system architects, engineers and integrators, compliance lawyers and marketing professionals. In his Foreword, surveillance studies guru Gary Marx says, '‘This state-of-the-art book describes the most comprehensive tool yet available for policy-makers to evaluate new personal data information technologies before they are introduced.'’ This book could save your organisation many thousands or even millions of euros (or dollars) and the damage to your organisation’s reputation and to the trust of employees, customers or citizens if it suffers a data breach that could have been avoided if only it had performed a privacy impact assessment before deploying a new technology, product, service or other initiative involving personal data. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012, First softcover printing 2012.

AB  - In early 2007, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC) embarked on a project to measure the extent to which privacy issues arising from government operations were being appropriately managed. The audit, titled Assessing the Privacy Impacts of Programs, Plans and Policies, was the first of its kind in Canada and, to the best of our knowledge, the only comprehensive evaluation of the implementation of privacy impact assessments (PIAs) worldwide. It was an important initiative, not only for its findings - many of which can be applied crossjurisdictionally - but also for its salutary effects on PIA practices government-wide. While the primary objective of the audit was to assess compliance with the government’s policy on PIAs, it has served as importantly to promote an understanding of PIAs as an effective risk management tool. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.

AB  - In this chapter the authors present their information model implemented for one pilot developed in the "RFID from Farm to Fork" (F2F) project which looks for the extension of RFID technologies throughout the complete food chain. They describe the privacy assessment proposed by the European Union that allows the evaluation of the privacy and security impact for a RFID application under study. The main privacy risks have been identified and described by the related EU Directives concerning RFID technology. The authors describe the questionnaire elaborated by the EU to assess the privacy robustness level of a RFID application, and they showcase a real wine pilot deployed in Spain. In this chapter, the authors also examine the privacy risks in the middleware communication with both RFID reader and back-end system. The EPCIS has been the Open Source middleware solution adopted in the F2F project. For the F2F pilot deployed in the wine sector, the authors describe the privacy impact assessment questionnaire designed for this case. Finally, they discuss the threads on the RFID tags, the advantages provided by the WISP technology in this regard and its repercussion on the risk questionnaire. © 2013, IGI Global.

AB  - In this paper, we present a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) decision support tool that can be integrated within a cloud computing environment. Privacy is an important consideration in cloud computing, as actual or perceived privacy weaknesses will impact legal compliance, data security, and user trust. A PIA is a systematic process for evaluating the possible future effects that a particular activity or proposal may have on an individual's privacy. It focuses on understanding the system, initiative or scheme, identifying and mitigating adverse privacy impacts and informing decision makers who must decide whether the project should proceed and in what form. A PIA, as a proactive business process, is thus properly distinguished from reactive processes, such as privacy issue analysis, privacy audits and privacy law compliance checking [1], applied to existing systems to ensure their continuing conformity with internal rules and external requirements. © 2010 IEEE.
