AB  - To assure certain critical quality properties (e.g., safety, security, or privacy), supervisory authorities and industrial associations provide reference frameworks such as standards or guidelines that in some cases are enforced (e.g., regulations). Given the pace at which both technical advancements and risks appear, there is an increase in the number of reference frameworks. As several frameworks might apply for same systems, certain overlaps appear (e.g., regulations for different countries where the system will operate, or generic standards in conjunction with more concrete standards for a given industrial sector or system type). We propose the use of modelling for alleviating the complexity of these reference frameworks ecosystems, and we provide a tool-supported method to create them for the benefit of different stakeholders. The case study is based on privacy data protection, and more concretely on privacy impact assessment processes. The European GDPR regulates the movement and processing of personal data, and, contrary to available software engineering privacy guidelines, articles in legal texts are usually difficult to translate to the underlying processes, artefacts and roles that they refer to. To facilitate the mutual comprehension of legal experts and engineers, in this work we investigate how mappings can be created between these two domains of expertise. Notably, we rely on modelling as a central point. We modelled the legal requirements of the GDPR on data protection impact assessments, and then, we selected the ISO/IEC 29134, a mainstream engineering guideline for privacy impact assessment, and, taking a concrete sector as example, the EU Smart Grid Data Protection Impact Assessment template. The OpenCert tool was used for providing technical support to both the modelling and the creation of the mapping models in a systematic way. We provide a qualitative evaluation from legal experts and privacy engineering practitioners to report on the benefits and limitations of this approach.

AB  - Many threats and attacks have been found in online social networks. When a security incident happens and data loss occurs, it is important to assess how the lost data affects user privacy. Most approaches for privacy impact assessment are based on checklists and auditions. There is lack of quantitative analysis approach to study privacy impact. Privacy impact assessment is a very challenging issue. First, data loss includes direct data loss, indirect data loss, and potential data loss. The impact of these data loss to user privacy should all be considered. Second, privacy impact assessment requires measuring privacy. Privacy measurement itself is a challenging issue. Third, users are all connected in a social network. Data loss may spread and propagate across the whole social network. In this paper, we summarize issues and challenges for privacy impact assessment. We further propose a quantitative analysis approach to assess privacy impact for online social networks. Two particular challenges are considered in the paper, privacy impact assessment when partial user information is disclosed, and privacy impact assessment when a group of user accounts are compromised. The paper provides a quantitative analysis approach for government agencies, enterprises, and organizations to assess privacy impact for online social networks when a security incident occurs.

AB  - Europe's proposed Data Protection Regulation is expected to make data protection impact assessment (DPIA) mandatory, a development that could impact hundreds of thousands of organizations (both governmental and private sector) in Europe, as well as non-European entities offering their wares and services there. This article reviews the DPIA provisions outlined in the new regulation. For the nuts and bolts of a privacy impact assessment (PIA) methodology, Europe could select features from the PIA methodologies used in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States, the countries with the most experience in PIA. A European Commission (EC)-funded project, called PIAF, reviewed these various methodologies and proposed an optimized PIA for Europe (and elsewhere) based on the best practices of the aforementioned countries. Based on these best practices, this article outlines a 16-step PIA process. It argues that while some organizations may regard a PIA as a hassle, in fact, a PIA offers many benefits, as spotlighted in the article.

AB  - The assessment of the potential impact for an organization from a privacy violation incident is important for three main reasons: the organization will have a justified estimate of the cost (financial, reputation or other) that may be raised, will facilitate the selection of the appropriate technical, procedural and organizational protection mechanisms and also will be compliant with the new General Data Protection Regulation that will be in effect from May 2018. Today, there are several methods to do a Privacy Impact Assessment but none of these quantifies the results according to specific metrics and thus can be significantly affected by various subjective parameters. Furthermore, the specific organizational characteristics (size, activities, number of clients, type of offered services etc.) are very rarely accounted, a fact that also affects the accuracy of the results. In this paper, a privacy impact assessment method that explicitly takes into account the organizational characteristics and employs a list of well-defined metrics as input, is presented.

AB  - The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) harmonizes personal data protection laws across the European Union, affecting all sectors including the healthcare industry. For processing operations that pose a high risk for data subjects, a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is mandatory from May 2018. Taking into account the criticality of the process and the importance of its results, for the protection of the patients' health data, as well as the complexity involved and the lack of past experience in applying such methodologies in healthcare environments, this paper presents the main steps of a DPIA study and provides guidelines on how to carry them out effectively. To this respect, the Privacy Impact Assessment, Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertes (PIA-CNIL) methodology has been employed, which is also compliant with the privacy impact assessment tasks described in ISO/IEC 29134:2017. The work presented in this paper focuses on the first two steps of the DPIA methodology and more specifically on the identification of the Purposes of Processing and of the data categories involved in each of them, as well as on the evaluation of the organization's GDPR compliance level and of the gaps (Gap Analysis) that must be filled-in. The main contribution of this work is the identification of the main organizational and legal requirements that must be fulfilled by the health care organization. This research sets the legal grounds for data processing, according to the GDPR and is highly relevant to any processing of personal data, as it helps to structure the process, as well as be aware of data protection issues and the relevant legislation.

AB  - Privacy and data protection have become more and more important in the recent years since an increasing number of enterprises and startups are harvesting personal data as a part of their business model. One central requirement of the GDPR is the implementation of a data protection impact assessment for privacy critical systems. However, the law does not dictate a special assessment methods.
   In this paper we compare different data protection impact assessment methods. We have developed a comparison and evaluation methodology and applied this to three of the most widespread assessment frameworks. The result of this comparison shows the weaknesses and strength, but also clearly indicates that none of the tested methods fulfills all desired properties. Thus, the development of a new or improved data protection impact assessment framework is an important open issue for future work.

AB  - Big Data Analytics enables today's businesses and organisations to process and utilise the raw data that is generated on a daily basis. While Big Data Analytics has improved effi-ciency and created many opportunities, it has also increased the risk of personal data being compromised or breached. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) mandates Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) as a means of identifying appropriate controls to miti-gate risks associated with the protection of personal data. However, little is currently known about how to conduct such a DPIA in a Big Data Analytics context. To this end, we conducted a systematic literature review with the aim of identifying privacy and data protection risks specific to the Big Data Analytics context that could negatively impact individuals' rights and freedoms when they occur. Based on a sample of 159 articles, we applied a thematic analysis to all identified risks which resulted in the definition of nine Privacy Touch Points that summarise the identified risks. The coverage of these Privacy Touch Points was then analysed for ten Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) methodologies. The insights gained from our analysis will inform the next phase of our research, in which we aim to develop a com-prehensive DPIA methodology that will enable data processors and data controllers to iden-tify, analyse and mitigate privacy and data protection risks when storing and processing data involving Big Data Analytics.(c) 2021 Georgios Georgiadis and Geert Poels.

AB  - The large increase in the collection of location, communication, health data etc. from seized digital devices like mobile phones, tablets, IoT devices, laptops etc. often poses serious privacy risks. To measure privacy risks, privacy impact assessments (PIA) are substantially useful tools and the Directive EU 2016/80 (Police Directive) requires their use. While much has been said about PIA methods pursuant to the Regulation EU 2016/679 (GDPR), less has been said about PIA methods pursuant to the Police Directive. Yet, little research has been done to explore and measure privacy risks that are specific to law enforcement activities which necessitate the processing of large amounts of data. This study tries to fill this gap by conducting a PIA on a big data forensic platform as a case study. This study also answers the question how a PIA should be carried out for large-scale digital forensic operations and describes the privacy risks, threats we learned from conducting it. Finally, it articulates concrete privacy measures to demonstrate compliance with the Police Directive. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - With the recent introduction of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), privacy impact assessments (PIA) have become mandatory in many cases. To support organisations in correctly implementing those, researchers and practitioners have provided reference processes and tooling. Integrating automation features into PIA tools can streamline the implementation of compliant privacy impact assessments in organizations. Based on a general reference architecture and reference process based on guidance by authorities, this contribution offers a systematic analysis of which process steps show the most promise with regard to this, and discusses impediments to this approach and directions for future research.

KW  - Data protection and privacy impact assessments
KW  - PRIVACY IMPACT ASSESSMENT
AB  - The goal of this contribution is to understand the notion of risk as it is enshrined in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), with a particular on Art. 35 providing for the obligation to carry out data protection impact assessments (DPIAs), the first risk management tool to be enshrined in EU data protection law, and which therefore contains a number of key elements in order to grasp the notion. The adoption of this risk-based approach has not come without a number of debates and controversies, notably on the scope and meaning of the risk-based approach. Yet, what has remained up to date out of the debate is the very notion of risk itself, which underpins the whole risk-based approach. The contribution uses the notions of risk and risk analysis as tools for describing and understanding risk in the GDPR. One of the main findings is that the GDPR risk is about "compliance risk" (i.e., the lower the compliance the higher the consequences upon the data subjects' rights).This stance is in direct contradiction with a number of positions arguing for a strict separation between compliance and risk issues. This contribution sees instead issues of compliance and risk to the data subjects rights and freedoms as deeply interconnected. The conclusion will use these discussions as a basis to address the long-standing debate on the differences between privacy impact assessments (PlAs) and DPIAs. They will also warn against the fact that ultimately the way risk is defined in the GDPR is somewhat irrelevant: what matters most is the methodology used and the type of risk at work therein.

AB  - One needs to look only at recent data breaches to be reminded of the severe and far-reaching damage caused by privacy threats. In light of these threats, global healthcare leaders are striving to understand how to protect patient information without the loss of benefits (utility) that results from privacy-preserving mechanisms. Consequently, our study examines the relatively unexplored issue of simultaneously responding to information privacy threats and maintaining utility in a healthcare privacy compliance context. Counterintuitively, we also identify a symbiotic relationship between these two focal and interdependent efforts. We adopt an interpretive qualitative research method leveraging the value-focused thinking (VFT) approach which results in two major contributions: (1) the development of a value-driven framework presented as a means-end objective network providing a list of 16 means objectives and seven key fundamental objectives enabling higher-quality privacy decision making vis-a-vis privacy and utility. Our second and central contribution (2) is a theoretical framework of privacy impact assessment (PIA) emphasising the interplay and balance between making appropriate decisions in responding to information privacy while not hindering healthcare operations. This work provides the foundation for proposing four compelling propositions for future healthcare privacy research.

AB  - In this paper, we critically examine the effectiveness of the requirement to conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) in Article 35 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in light of fairness metrics. Through this analysis, we explore the role of the fairness principle as introduced in Article 5(1)(a) and its multifaceted interpretation in the obligation to conduct a DPIA. Our paper argues that although there is a significant theoretical role for the considerations of fairness in the DPIA process, an analysis of the various guidance documents issued by data protection authorities on the obligation to conduct a DPIA reveals that they rarely mention the fairness principle in practice. Our analysis questions this omission, and assesses the capacity of fairness metrics to be truly operationalized within DPIAs. We conclude by exploring the practical effectiveness of DPIA with particular reference to (1) technical challenges that have an impact on the usefulness of DPIAs irrespective of a controller's willingness to actively engage in the process, (2) the context dependent nature of the fairness principle, and (3) the key role played by data controllers in the determination of what is fair.

AB  - Privacy impact assessments (PIAs) are emerging as an important privacy management tool for public and private sector organizations. However, a key concern of PIA policy and practice is the lack of follow-up and means to evaluate its conduct at different levels, particularly so that different stakeholders can make sense of PIA practice as evidenced in PIA reports. This article first outlines the evaluation criteria established under the EU Privacy Impact Assessment Framework project and attempts to find the best means of extending their application to help assess PIAs, based on good practice.

AB  - The process of digitalization of societies and innovation is involving the fast introduction of new technologies in different sectors. However, the development of technology represents a challenge as it involves technical, legal, economic and social aspects that have to be considered since its conception or design. The aim of this paper is to offer an adaptation of an existing legal methodology, the Data Protection Impact Assessment, as a legal obligation to evaluate technological proposals and assure compliance with privacy by design requirements. For that purpose, we will refer to the specific case of Identity Management technologies. We introduce the main challenges in the sector of Digital Identity Management as well as the importance of covering the "architecture" and "user" sides in the development of safer technologies by citing concrete examples. Finally, in order to provide a more practical view of the methodology to adapt the Data Protection Impact Assessment, we refer to the work developed in the research project OLYMPUS in the evaluation of its privacy implications. By introducing this example, the paper offers a specific methodology directly reusable for the study of technological proposals in IdM but that can be adapted to any other sector.

AB  - Democracy in Australia is gravely threatened by a flood of measures harmful to human rights that have been introduced since 2001, a large proportion of which are unjustified and not subject to effective controls. The passage of these measures through the Parliament has been achieved on the basis of their proponents' assertions and without appropriate scrutiny. Parliament had available to it various forms of impact assessment techniques, but failed to require that such methods be applied.
   The study reported here had as its focus one particular form of evaluation Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA). The study found that the PIA process should have been performed for each proposal, but was in fact seldom applied, and where it was applied the process and report were in almost all cases seriously deficient.
   Survival of democracy is dependent on the Parliament standing up to the national security extremism that has taken hold of the Attorney-General's Department. Ministers and Parliamentary Committees must demand prior evaluation of proposals that restrict civil freedoms, must ensure transparency in relation to the proposals and their justification, and must require effective controls over, and mitigation features within, those measures that survive the evaluation process.

AB  - In Sep. 2015, the Act on the Use of Numbers to Identify a Specific Individual in the Administrative Procedure was revised. It was decided to link personal numbers to deposit numbers of financial institutions. Currently, the Privacy Impact Assessment which is obliged to implement this law is required to implement safety control measures for the private sector. However, there is no system to conduct a risk assessment of the law. In the financial industry, which is a highly private sector of public nature, some privacy risk assessment is required because it has many individual numbers. In this paper, we propose a framework for privacy risk assessment on this law in the financial industry, using the privacy impact assessment prescribed as an international standard.

AB  - There is growing interest in Europe in privacy impact assessment (PIA). The UK introduced the first PIA methodology in Europe in 2007, and Ireland followed in 2010. PIAs provide a way to detect potential privacy problems, take precautions and build tailored safeguards before, not after, the organisation makes heavy investments in the development of a new technology, service or product. This paper presents some findings from the Privacy Impact Assessment Framework (PIAP) project and, in particular, the project's first deliverable, which analyses the similarities and differences between PIA methodologies in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States, with a view to picking out the best elements which could be used in constructing an optimised PIA methodology for Europe. The project, which began in January 2011, is being undertaken for the European Commission's Directorate General Justice. The first deliverable was completed in September. The paper provides some background on privacy impact assessment, identifies some of its benefits and discusses elements that can be used in construction of a state-of-the-art PIA methodology.

AB  - The security threats related to personally identifiable information are increasing dramatically. In addition to government agencies, large international companies are potential victims. To comply with regulations such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, organizations are required to carry out a privacy impact assessment. However, the conventional information security risk assessment model does not provide a clear methodology for conducting privacy impact assessments. In this paper, we propose a privacy-considered information security risk assessment (pISRA) model, which can take both a privacy impact analysis and risk assessment into consideration. Our proposed model can help risk assessors achieve a comparable and reproducible approach for the entire risk assessment process. Additionally, pISRA can assist organizations to select high-risk items for further action.

This new tool of the GDPR is highly relevant for any processing of personal data, as it helps to structure the process, be aware of data protection issues and the relevant legislation and implement proper safeguards to protect data subjects. For processing operations posing a high risk for data subjects, a DPIA is mandatory from May 2018. The interactive workshop provided a framework for DPIA and guidance on specific questions such as when a high risk is likely to occur or how specific risks can be evaluated, which was assessed by participants in an interactive session with two different scenarios.

Provenance graphs often entangle data relating to multiple individuals. It is therefore a challenge to protect personal data from unintended disclosure in provenance graphs. In this paper, we provide a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) template for identifying imminent privacy threats that arise from provenance graphs in an application-agnostic setting. The PIA template identifies privacy threats, lists potential countermeasures, helps to manage personal data protection risks, and maintains compliance with privacy data protection laws and regulations.

AB  - Among the numerous challenges that organisations face, information security is undoubtedly an important concern, and as of lately, compliance with personal data regulation (e.g., the General Data Protection Regulation - GDPR in the EU) is a necessity, while requirements for privacy-by-design need also to be met. This paper proposes a comprehensive method to support the identification, modelling, (re)design, implementation, and realisation of privacy aware/compliant business processes, in order to incorporate personal data protection principles into all work practices and business processes in an organisation. More specifically, this method integrates the main steps of a Data Protection Impact Assessment into business process management, to ensure the identification of personal data flow throughout the organisation and support the assessment of privacy-related risks and enhance personal data protection.

AB  - Innovations in emerging technologies have an impact on privacy and fundamental rights. For example, emerging technologies include future biometric systems for crime prevention. In contrast to large-scale biometric systems for migration control, these systems promise to track down terrorists and organized criminals but also entail novel risks for society. One can govern science and technology by means of privacy impact assessments (which are currently being researched). Alternatively there is the approach used in this paper that primarily builds on the assumption that technology design can render the violation of a legal norm impossible. Using German and European constitutional law as an example, this paper will present proposals for technology design derived from the law.

AB  - Forensic scientists around the world are adopting new technology platforms capable of efficiently analysing a larger proportion of the human genome. Undertaking this analysis could provide significant operational benefits, particularly in giving investigators more information about the donor of genetic material, a particularly useful investigative lead. Such information could include predicting externally visible characteristics such as eye and hair colour, as well as biogeographical ancestry. This article looks at the adoption of this new technology from a privacy perspective, using this to inform and critique the application of a Privacy Impact Assessment to this emerging technology. Noting the benefits and limitations, the article develops a number of themes that would influence a model Privacy Impact Assessment as a contextual framework for forensic laboratories and law enforcement agencies considering implementing forensic DNA phenotyping for operational use.

AB  - Rule of law principles are essential for a fair and just society and apply to government activities regardless of whether those activities are undertaken by a human or automated data processing. This article explores how Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) could provide a mechanism for improved rule of law governance of data processing systems developed and used by government for public purposes in civil and administrative areas. Applying rule of law principles to two case studies provides a sketch of the issues and concerns that this article's proposals for DPIAs seek to address. The article undertakes comparative analysis to find relevant principles and concepts for governance of data processing systems, looking at human rights impact assessments, administrative law, and process rights in environmental law. Drawing on this comparative analysis to identify specific recommendations for DPIAs, the article offers guidance on bow DPIAs could be used to strengthen the governance of data processing by government in rule of law terms.

AB  - Privacy Impact Assessments (PIA) are recognized as a key step to enhance privacy protection in new information systems and services. They will be required in Europe when the new General Data Protection Regulation becomes effective. From a technical perspective, the core of a PIA is a Privacy Risk Analysis (PRA), which has received relatively less attention than organizational and legal aspects of PIAs. In this work, we propose a rigorous and systematic PRA methodology. We illustrate it with a quantified self use-case in the extended paper [9].

KW  - METHODOLOGY
AB  - Data Protection by Design (DPbD) is a truly interdisciplinary effort that involves many stakeholders such as legal experts, requirements engineers, software architects, developers, and system operators. Building software-intensive systems that respect the fundamental rights to privacy and data protection is the result of intensive dialogue and careful trade-off decisions.
   In practice however, there is a dichotomy between the legal reasoning which is conducted in Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA) and software engineering approaches, such as threat modeling, aimed at identifying privacy requirements and privacy risks. These activities are commonly performed in total isolation, which negatively impacts (i) the compliance exercise, (ii) the ability to evolve the system over time, and (iii) the architectural trade-offs made during system design.
   In this article, we present an architectural viewpoint for describing software architectures from a legal, data protection perspective whose core modeling abstractions are based on an in-depth legal analysis of the EU General Data Protection Regulation. This viewpoint is tied to Data Flow Diagrams -commonly used in threat modeling- through correspondence rules. The proposed viewpoint supports the automation of a number of data protection impact assessment steps through (i) meta-model constraints, (ii) model analysis, and (iii) interaction with the involved stakeholders. This enables a streamlined compliance exercise, reconciling legal privacy and data protection notions with architecture-driven software engineering practices. We validate our approach in the context of a realistic e-health application for a number of complementary development scenarios.

AB  - Personal data is sensitive information asset primarily needed to be protected. In order to protect personal data, privacy-protected rules, designs, guidelines, and legal arrangements have been developed so far. Especially, Privacy Impact Assessment methods have been developed with a growing interest in European countries. However, developing information technologies leave these studies insufficient. In this work, a new feature based Privacy Impact Assessment method is proposed for the purpose of protection of personal data. This study focuses on evaluating the privacy impact of data set at attribute level instead of evaluating all of the data which is a general approach to protect data. With the help of calculation at feature level, more sensitive and private personal data parts can be defined and hidden. Data homogeneity method is preferred for privacy impact evaluation calculations. The outcome of this work is data items grouped by privacy impact. According to our proposal, more homogeneous data is more sensitive and its privacy is important. The proposed method is tested on two different data set and the obtained results are analyzed. The most important finding of our work is that attributes that do not appear to be private can be private after combining attributes.

TI  - Privacy impact assessment in the design of transnational public health information systems: the BIRO project
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS
LA  - English
AB  - Objectives: To foster the development of a privacy-protective, sustainable cross-border information system in the framework of a European public health project.
   Materials and methods: A targeted privacy impact assessment was implemented to identify the best architecture for a European information system for diabetes directly tapping into clinical registries. Four steps were used to provide input to software designers and developers: a structured literature search, analysis of data flow scenarios or options, creation of an ad hoc questionnaire and conduction of a Delphi procedure.
   Results: The literature search identified a core set of relevant papers on privacy (n = 11). Technicians envisaged three candidate system architectures, with associated data flows, to source an information flow questionnaire that was submitted to the Delphi panel for the selection of the best architecture. A detailed scheme envisaging an "aggregation by group of patients'' was finally chosen, based upon the exchange of finely tuned summary tables.
   Conclusions: Public health information systems should be carefully engineered only after a clear strategy for privacy protection has been planned, to avoid breaching current regulations and future concerns and to optimise the development of statistical routines. The BIRO (Best Information Through Regional Outcomes) project delivers a specific method of privacy impact assessment that can be conveniently used in similar situations across Europe.

AB  - Privacy-aware software development is gaining more and more importance for nearly all information systems that are developed nowadays. As a tool to force organizations and companies to consider privacy properly during the planning and the execution of their projects, some governments advise to perform privacy impact assessments (PIAs). During a PIA, a report has to be created that summarizes the consequence on privacy the project may have and how the organization or company addresses these consequences. As basis for a PIA, it has to be documented which personal data is collected, processed, stored, and shared with others in the context of the project. Obtaining this information is a difficult task that is not yet well supported by existing methods. In this paper, we present a method based on the problem-based privacy analysis (ProPAn) that helps to elicit the needed information for a PIA systematically from a given set of functional requirements. Our tool-supported method shall reduce the effort that has to be spent to elicit the information needed to conduct a PIA in a way that the information is as complete and consistent as possible.

AB  - Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) seamlessly integrate physical objects with technology, thereby blurring the boundaries between the physical and virtual environments. While this brings many opportunities for progress, it also adds a new layer of complexity to the risk assessment process when attempting to ascertain what privacy risks this might impose on an organisation. In addition, privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), mandate assessment of privacy risks, including making Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) compulsory. We present the DPIA Data Wheel, a holistic privacy risk assessment framework based on Contextual Integrity (CI), that practitioners can use to inform decision making around the privacy risks of CPS. This framework facilitates comprehensive contextual inquiry into privacy risk, that accounts for both the elicitation of privacy risks, and the identification of appropriate mitigation strategies. Further, by using this DPIA framework we also provide organisations with a means of assessing privacy from both the perspective of the organisation and the individual, thereby facilitating GDPR compliance. We empirically evaluate this framework in three different real-world settings. In doing so, we demonstrate how CI can be incorporated into the privacy risk decision-making process in a usable, practical manner that will aid decision makers in making informed privacy decisions.

KW  - DESIGN
AB  - Purpose
   This paper aims to practically guide privacy impact assessment (PIA) implementation by proposing a PIA process incorporating best practices from existing PIA guidelines and privacy research.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This paper critically reviews and assesses generic PIA methods proposed by related research, data protection authorities and standard's organizations, to identify best practices and practically support PIA practitioners. To address identified gaps, best practices from privacy literature are proposed.
   Findings
   This paper proposes a PIA process based on best practices, as well as an evaluation framework for existing PIA guidelines, focusing on practical support to PIA practitioners.
   Practical implications - The proposed PIA process facilitates PIA practitioners in organizing and implementing PIA projects. This paper also provides an evaluation framework, comprising a comprehensive set of 17 criteria, for PIA practitioners to assess whether PIA methods/guidelines can adequately support requirements of their PIA projects (e.g. special legal framework and needs for PIA project organization guidance).
   Originality/value
   This research extends PIA guidelines (e.g. ISO 29134) by providing comprehensive and practical guidance to PIA practitioners. The proposed PIA process is based on best practices identified from evaluation of nine commonly used PIA methods, enriched with guidelines from privacy literature, to accommodate gaps and support tasks that were found to be inadequately described or lacking practical guidance.

AB  - In the digital age, the interaction between privacy; data protection and advanced technological developments such as big data analytics has become pertinent to Europol's effectiveness in providing accurate crime analyses. For the purposes of preventing and combating crime falling within the scope of its objectives, it is imperative for Europol to employ the fullest and most up-to-date information and technical capabilities possible whilst respecting fundamental human rights.
   The present article addresses precisely the "paradox" of on one side protecting fundamental human rights against external terrorist and/or cybercrime intrusions, and on the other providing a privacy-conscious approach to data collection and analytics, so that Europol can even more effectively support and strengthen action in protecting society against internal threats in a proportionate, responsible and legitimate manner. The advantage proposed in this very context of large quantities of data informing strategic analysis at Europol is a purpose-oriented data protection impact assessment. Namely, the evolution from traditional instruments in the fight against organised crime and terrorism to more technologically advanced ones equally requires an alteration of the conventional notions of privacy and investigative and information-sharing methods.

AB  - Many employers now use complex algorithms to assess job applications. These algorithms can have discriminatory effects for women, ethnic minorities, people with disabilities and other legally protected groups. This article evaluates the application of UK law to the use of such algorithms, and finds that equality and data protection laws seek to balance the harms of these tools against the benefits of their use. The article then considers the application of these laws in practice, and finds that the opacity of automated hiring poses a significant challenge to enforcement. The article suggests that a 'transparent recruitment scheme' should therefore be introduced, which would incentivise the publication of equality metrics contained in employers' data protection impact assessments. This scheme should be a collaborative effort between the Information Commissioner's Office and the Equality and Human Rights Commission.

AB  - The importance of privacy by design has increased with initiatives such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). While static, design-level assessment of privacy aspects provides considerable benefits in the creation of privacy-preserving software-intensive systems, operational aspects that are difficult to predict at design-time also play a key role. This is particularly true in the instance of privacy impact or privacy risk: while existing approaches succeed fairly well in assessing the overall risk from a static design context, they are not well suited to capture risk elements that are dynamic and often impossible to foresee.
   In this position paper, we highlight this problem at the basis of a number of realistic motivational scenarios and outline our vision towards continuous privacy impact assessment and risk management.

CP  - 9th International Conference on Knowledge-Based Intelligent Information and Engineering Systems
AB  - Ubiquitous computing demands a fundamental shift in the control of personal in-formation. Ubiquitous computing requires disclosure of personal information. The technology infrastructure means the basic components of the IT society such as web servers, DB, N/W, personal information devices, etc. And they can flow the personal information through the society. Business application systems which collect, store, process and/or disclose personal information should be identified and categorized. The process map for personal in-formation handling should document the flow of data from collection through all paths, internal and external, including all processing points, access/display points and destruction points. At this level, risks to personal information can be better understood. In this paper, we present the information privacy engineering for constructing to prevent the privacy invasion and measuring the economic value of privacy. We hope this privacy engineering will be used as one of the tool for protecting the users in ubiquitous age. The approach includes the followings; The Privacy Protection in Network, The database modeling in UbiComp, The privacy impact assessment in UbiComp.

AB  - With female names, voices and characters, artificially intelligent Virtual Personal Assistants such as Alexa, Cortana, and Siri appear to be decisively gendered female. Through an exploration of the various facets of gendering at play in the design of Siri, Alexa and Cortana, we argue that this gendering of VPAs as female may pose a societal harm, insofar as they reproduce normative assumptions about the role of women as submissive and secondary to men. In response, this article turns to examine the potential role and scope of data protection law as one possible solution to this problem. In particular, we examine the role of data privacy impact assessments that highlight the need to go beyond the data privacy paradigm, and require data controllers to consider and address the social impact of their products.

AB  - In this paper, we compared the requirements of previously developed manual and ISO/IEC 29134:2017 and analyzed the changes. As a result, there were no major differences in requirements. It is useful to conduct a privacy impact assessment (PIA) before actually operating the system to appropriately construct and operate a system that handles personal information. A manual (procedure manual) is necessary to implement PIA efficiently. In June 2017, ISO issued the ISO/IEC 29134:2017 as an international standard on PIA. Cause the past PIA manual developed based on ISO 22307:2008, development of a PIA manual conforming to ISO/IEC 29134:2017 was required. By our analysis, as a newly stated matter, ISO/IEC 29134:2017 explicitly indicated Due Diligence, stakeholder engagement, and risk countermeasures. Based on the analysis results, we propose a new PIA manual reflecting the requirements of ISO/IEC 29134:2017.

AB  - The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has recently come into effect and insofar as Internet of Things (IoT) applications touch EU citizens or their data, developers are obliged to exercise due diligence and ensure they undertake Data Protection by Design and Default (DPbD). GDPR mandates the use of Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) as a key heuristic enabling DPbD. However, research has shown that developers generally lack the competence needed to deal effectively with legal aspects of privacy management and that the difficulties of complying with regulation are likely to grow considerably. Privacy engineering seeks to shift the focus from interpreting texts and guidelines or consulting legal experts to embedding data protection within the development process itself. There are, however, few examples in practice. We present a privacy-oriented, flow-based integrated development environment (IDE) for building domestic IoT applications. The IDE enables due diligence in (a) helping developers reason about personal data during the actual in vivo construction of IoT applications; (b) advising developers as to whether or not the design choices they are making occasion the need for a DPIA; and (c) attaching and making available to others (including data processors, data controllers, data protection officers, users and supervisory authorities) specific privacy-related information that has arisen during an application's development.

We utilize data from a relevant IoT smart-health care project in Indonesia. On structuring the final regulatory recommendations, we have conducted in-depth interview to the stake holders of Indonesian IoT smart-health care service. The results show that there are 5 aspects that need to be set in the proposed regulations, i.e. security compliance, device security, secure communications, virtualization security, and application security. In each of that aspect, we have built specific recommendation to ensure IoT service provider giving the best service without decreasing comfort of private information protection.

AB  - Roboticists are grappling with how to address privacy in robot design at a time when regulatory frameworks around the world increasingly require systems to be engineered to preserve and protect privacy. This paper surveys the top robotics journals and conferences over the past four decades to identify contributions with respect to privacy in robot design. Our survey revealed that less than half of one percent of the similar to 89,120 papers in our study even mention the word privacy. Herein, we propose privacy preserving approaches for roboticists to employ in robot design, including, assessing a robot's purpose and environment; ensuring privacy by design by selecting sensors that do not collect information that is not essential to the core objectives of that robot; embracing both privacy and performance as fundamental design challenges to be addressed early in the robot lifecycle; and performing privacy impact assessments.

AB  - Background Data processing of health research databases often requires a Data Protection Impact Assessment to evaluate the severity of the risk and the appropriateness of measures taken to comply with the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We aimed to define and apply a comprehensive method for the evaluation of privacy, data governance and ethics among research networks involved in the EU Project Bridge Health. Methods Computerised survey among associated partners of main EU Consortia, using a targeted instrument designed by the principal investigator and progressively refined in collaboration with an international advisory panel. Descriptive measures using the percentage of adoption of privacy, data governance and ethical principles as main endpoints were used for the analysis and interpretation of the results. Results A total of 15 centres provided relevant information on the processing of sensitive data from 10 European countries. Major areas of concern were noted for: data linkage (median, range of adoption: 45%, 30%-80%), access and accuracy of personal data (50%, 0%-100%) and anonymisation procedures (56%, 11%-100%). A high variability was noted in the application of privacy principles. Conclusions A comprehensive methodology of Privacy and Ethics Impact and Performance Assessment was successfully applied at international level. The method can help implementing the GDPR and expanding the scope of Data Protection Impact Assessment, so that the public benefit of the secondary use of health data could be well balanced with the respect of personal privacy.

AB  - In the upcoming General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), privacy by design and privacy impact assessments are given an even more prominent role than before. It is now required that companies build privacy into the core of their technical products. Recently, researchers and industry players have proposed employing threat modeling methods, traditionally used in security engineering, as a way to bridge these two GDPR requirements in the process of engineering systems.
   Threat modeling, however, typically assumes a waterfall process and monolithic design, assumptions that are disrupted with the popularization of Agile methodologies and Service Oriented Architectures. Moreover, agile service environments make it easier to address some privacy problems, while complicating others. To date, the challenges of applying threat modeling for privacy in agile service environments remain understudied.
   This paper sets out to expose and analyze this gap. Specifically, we analyze what challenges and opportunities the shifts in software engineering practice introduce into traditional Threat Modeling activities; how they relate to the different Privacy Goals; and what Agile principles and Service properties have an impact on them.
   Our results show that both agile and services make the end-to-end analysis of applications more difficult. At the same time, the former allows for more efficient communications and iterative progress, while the latter enables the parallelization of tasks and the documentation of some architecture decisions.

AB  - The implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation within the European Union intensifies regulatory requirements in terms of data protection for Smart City services. In particular, the mandatory Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) process constitutes a complex managerial challenge. To reduce the complexity, this study develops a typology of Flemish Smart City services based on DPIA costs.
   Our explorative case study, based on face-to-face interviews and a workshop, shows that DPIA costs vary along the complexities of i) the urban environment in which a Smart City service is provided, and ii) the Smart City service itself. The research further demonstrates that these complexities represent multilayered concepts. The complexity of the urban environment consists of three layers: i) city size, ii) diversity of urban stakeholders, and iii) total of Smart City services in the urban region. Similarly, the complexity of the Smart City service is composed of five layers: i) number of different data streams, ii) clarity of data ownership, iii) amount of use-cases, iv) privacy invasiveness, and v) visibility of the Smart City service. While most layers of the respective complexities unequivocally matter in the eyes of the experts, others are more contested, such as the size of the city and the visibility of the Smart City service.
   This cost-based framework is of value to city administrations and Smart City service providers as it allows them to make the DPIA process more efficient by shortening the learning curve and improving decision making by clustering services based on data protection needs. In particular, stakeholders that have little expertise in-house, and that are looking for an easy-to-understand, rational framework can benefit from these results. Furthermore, based on both the literature review and the obtained results, our systematic data protection impact-cost-approach is generalizable beyond the EU-borders.

TI  - PIAs in Australia: A Work-In-Progress Report
T2  - PRIVACY IMPACT ASSESSMENT
LA  - English
AB  - Privacy impact assessment (PIA) has a long history in Australia, and some degree of maturity has been achieved. This chapter provides historical background to privacy laws in Australia and the emergence of PI As as a tool of government and business. It then evaluates the available guidance documents and indicates likely directions of future development.
   Privacy laws in Australia are in the process of being significantly weakened. As a result, merely complying with privacy laws will provide organisations with no assurance that their schemes will be acceptable to citizens and consumers. PIAs are, therefore, highly likely to assume increasing importance, as government agencies and corporations alike seek understanding of how to avoid negative media coverage and public opposition.

AB  - According to Article 35 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), data controllers are obligated to conduct a privacy impact assessment (PIA) to ensure the protection of sensitive data. Failure to properly protect sensitive data may affect data subjects negatively, and damage the reputation of data processors. Existing PIA approaches cannot be easily conducted, since they are mainly abstract or imprecise. Moreover, they lack a methodology to conduct the assessment concerning the design of IT systems. We propose a novel methodology to support PIA by performing model-based privacy and security analyses in the early phases of the system development. In our methodology, the design of a system is analyzed and, where necessary, appropriate security and privacy controls are suggested to improve the design. Hence, this methodology facilitates privacy by design as prescribed in Article 25 of the GDPR. We evaluated our methodology based on three industrial case studies and a quality-based comparison to the state of the art.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CONTINGENCIES AND CRISIS MANAGEMENT
LA  - English
AB  - The ability to harness technology in crisis management has enabled an increase in wide-scale interagency collaboration. This development has occurred alongside a move to accumulate and analyse crowdsourced responses. Given the scale and the nature of the information accessed and collected, there is a pressing need to ensure that technology is developed in a way that protects the interests of end-users and stakeholders. Privacy impact assessments (PIAs) are increasingly used, in certain jurisdictions legally mandated, in projects to foresee risks to privacy and to plan strategies to avoid these. Once implemented, the EU's General Data Protection Regulation will, in certain circumstances, require the need for a PIA. This study focuses upon the PIA process in an EU-funded project with the aim of developing cloud-based disaster response technology. It introduces the project and then gives a background to the PIA process. Insights and observations are then made relating to how the PIA operates, with the aim of drawing conclusions that can both improve the current project and be transferable to other crisis management-focused projects.

AB  - Recent controversies surrounding privacy have sparked a move by regulators toward the idea of privacy by design (PbD), a concept pioneered by Ontario Information and Privacy Commissioner Ann Cavoukian. Industry has also started to recognize the importance of taking privacy seriously, with various PbD corporate initiatives currently underway. However, some commentators have criticized PbD for being too vague. Using three case studies and a range of best practice examples of PbD, privacy impact assessments (PIAs), and privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs), this article addresses the gap between the abstract principles of PbD and their operationalization into more concrete implementation guidelines for software engineers.

KW  - Care system
AB  - Purpose In care homes concerns about abuse have established a culture where all information pertaining to a person must be shared, and little attention is paid to privacy in its broader sense. The purpose of this paper is to take a human rights perspective and consider how information governance may impact on the health, well-being and quality of life of residents. It proposes a proactive approach and presents a template for a privacy impact assessment which services could use to improve their approach to privacy, protecting the human rights of those in their care, contributing to their independence and improving outcomes. Design/methodology/approach A review of historical and current thinking about the value of privacy in human services and wider society leads to a series of challenges to the way in which privacy is upheld in residential care services. Findings Recent preoccupations with data privacy have led to a myopic neglect of broader considerations of privacy. Whilst it continues to be important to protect the confidentiality of personal data and to ensure that residents are protected from abuse, human services that provide 24 hour care in congregated settings must not neglect broader components of privacy. Research limitations/implications - Privacy impact assessments have been widely used to check whether data privacy is being upheld. The broader concept that might be termed "Big Privacy" is introduced within which data privacy is but one section. It is suggested that big privacy is severely compromised in residential care settings, thus denying residents their human right to privacy. The extent of such violation of rights should be investigated. Practical implications - Having set out the potential reach of the human right to privacy, important work needs to be done to find out how privacy might be upheld in the real world of congregate residential care. Some service providers may have solutions to the organisational challenges, have addressed staff training needs and revised risk assessment strategies so that privacy is upheld alongside other rights. Social implications - Nearly half a million people live in congregate residential care settings in England, and deprivation of privacy is argued to be a significant deprivation of human rights. Occasional tragedies and scandals in congregate settings create pressure for increasing the level of surveillance, and the right to privacy is sacrificed. This paper offers a challenge to this process, arguing that competing rights need to be balanced and privacy is an essential component of a decent quality of life. Originality/value Personal growth and development depends to some extent on choice and control over access to privacy. Recent changes in the law regarding data protection have narrowed our thinking about privacy until it is a small concept, largely concerned with data handling. This paper invites consideration of big privacy, and invites congregate residential care settings to consider how a deep and broad definition of privacy could transform these services.

PriCal provides context-adaptive privacy to users by detecting present persons and adapting event visibility according to the user's privacy preferences. We present a detailed privacy impact assessment of our system, which provides insights on how to leverage context to enhance privacy without being intrusive. PriCal is based on a decentralized architecture and supports the detection of registered users as well as unknown persons. In a three-week deployment study with seven displays, ten participants used PriCal in their real work environment with their own digital calendars. Our results provide qualitative insights on the implications, acceptance, and utility of context-adaptive privacy in the context of a calendar display system, indicating that it is a viable approach to mitigate privacy implications in ubicomp applications.

AB  - In the ubiquitous age, privacy will be the matter of trade-offs about pros and cons of revealing personal information for personalized services. Ubiquitous computing demands a fundamental shift in the control of personal information and requires disclosure of personal information. As we enjoy comfortable life, the invasion of personal information can be occurred at the same time. The privacy requires the effective security, but the effective security does not guarantee the effective privacy. We present the privacy engineering in order to prevent the privacy invasion and measure the economic value of privacy. We hope this privacy engineering in ubiComp will be used as one of the tool for protecting the users in the ubiquitous age. The approach includes the followings; the architecture of the privacy engineering, the database modeling, the privacy impact assessment, the economic value assessment of the privacy.

To address this problem, we propose an approach based on the identification of a set of sensitivity features, i.e. certain attributes of the assets or processing activities that are strongly related to the levels of impact of cyber-incidents. We apply our approach to revise the results of a Data Protection Impact Assessment, a mandatory activity for complying with GDPR, conducted in a medium-to-large organization of the Italian Public Administration, and we obtain encouraging results.

AB  - Building software-intensive systems that respect the fundamental rights to privacy and data protection requires explicitly addressing data protection issues at the early development stages. Data Protection by Design (DPbD) - as coined by Article 25(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - therefore calls for an iterative approach based on (i) the notion of risk to data subjects, (ii) a close collaboration between the involved stakeholders, and (iii) accountable decision-making.
   In practice, however, the legal reasoning behind DPbD is often conducted on the basis of informal system descriptions that lack systematicity and reproducibility. This affects the quality of Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA) - i. e. the concrete manifestation of DPbD at the organizational level. This is a major stumbling block when it comes to conducting a comprehensive and durable assessment of the risks that takes both the legal and technical complexities into account.
   In this article, we present DPMF, a data protection modeling framework that allows for a comprehensive and accurate description of the data processing operations in terms of the key concepts used in the GDPR. The proposed modeling approach accommodates a number of legal reasonings and assessments that are commonly addressed in a DPIA exercise (e. g., the compatibility of purposes). The DPMF is supported in a prototype modeling tool and its practical applicability is validated in the context of a realistic eHealth system for a number of complementary development scenarios.

AB  - As geographers, we often work with personal data, meaning that the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) can have a major impact upon our research. The GDPR is a set of legal requirements that serves to ensure the protection of personal data. In this paper, we reflect on our experiences of how the GDPR impacts upon the planning and conduct of (international) geographical research; and develop good data protection practices for geography. In so doing, we explore the Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) as a method to explore data protection and privacy issues and discuss three relevant issues for geographers in relation to the GDPR: (1) informing research participants; (2) data management; and (3) international collaboration. Although it is time-consuming to make a project 'GDPR proof', the process helps researchers to thoroughly think through its privacy implications at an early stage. Thus, the GDPR does not make geographical research impossible, but rather contributes to making it more effective and fairer.

AB  - With the increasing number of smart devices and connections in Internet of Things (IoT) comes risks-specifically involving consumer data protection. In this respect, this exploratory research examines the current issues of IoT and personal data protection in Malaysia that includes: regulatory frameworks and data governance; issues and gaps; and key challenges in implementation. Results from this mixed-methods research indicates that a majority of consumers expressed concern about personal data risks due to increased usage of IoT devices. Moreover, there is a crucial need to increase regulation and accountability in the industry. In this regard, collaboration and partnerships between the main stakeholders are essential in tackling emerging issues of IoT and personal data protection. In order to strengthen IoT data governance, the fundamentals should be: strengthening consumer education and smart partnership between government-industry-civil society; providing motivation for active participation of NGOs and civil society; and obtaining industry buy-in. This paper also proposes a structure for the governance of evolving data-related technology, particularly in the case of data breaches or cyber incidents. It adds to the wider discussion of the current scenario, and proposes a model of collective responsibility in IoT data governance that is underpinned by the three principles of fair information practices, privacy impact assessment and privacy accountability.

AB  - Privacy in health information system is important to ensure the confidentiality of sensitive and personal information belongs to individual remain intact. There are numerous cases of unauthorised intrusions of personal health information occurred but no legal action can be exerted due to the absence of a privacy act in Malaysia. Therefore, a preliminary observation has been conducted to review the current privacy implementations in management of personal health information at Malaysian government hospitals. Analysis was conducted based on OECD Fair Information Practices Guideline which has been the benchmark of most of the privacy and data protection legislation in the world. Interviews were conducted with key personnel in medical informatics and legal expertise using Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) technique as guidance. The findings of the observation were then compared with the existing health information privacy acts. Then, recommendations were made to include those findings in the proposed privacy law or policy in Malaysia.

In this work, we describe the existing technological solutions to express online consent in a positive fashion, including all the properties that an online solution should hold. We conclude by offering a risk proposal based on the linear combination of the rating of each one of these properties. We observe a low agreement between observers, highlighting that it is not easy to fulfill the requirements of the GDPR and showing that these studies are important when performing a Data Protection Impact Assessment. To overcome the low agreement, we propose the median of the observers' rate.

AB  - Nowadays, data processing components are often part of a multitude of products and services. The current review of the European data protection framework, is proposing the replacement of the Data Protection Directive with a Regulation, which will undoubtedly impact the development of such products and services. This chapter analyses some of the critical changes proposed in the Regulation, highlighting the developments with regard to the actual scope of application of the European legal framework, the consent of the users and the particularities of processing pseudonymous data. It also critically assesses the proposed obligations relating to data security, notification of personal data breaches, the principles of data protection by design and by default, as well as data protection impact assessments. The authors conclude that these changes may actually be a step in the direction of more privacy-aware development of products and applications that entail data processing operations, if certain modalities are taken into account before the final adoption of the draft Regulation.

The challenge with current work on privacy conflict is the necessity to understand the perceived levels of sensitivity to facilitate negotiations. It is unclear how this can be achieved in DPIA procedure. In this work we introduce our model checking tool along with our method to address privacy conflict. We present our evaluation plan before concluding with our research roadmap.

AB  - The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) imposes different requirements for data controllers collecting personal data to protect individuals' privacy. This fact triggered many studies and projects to investigate Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) for the fulfillment of the compliance requirements. In this paper, after reviewing some of the current challenges and gaps in GDPR compliance, we argue the use of Semantic Technologies in PETs in the form of an Intelligent Compliance Agent (ICA) to support data controllers in carrying out a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA). Models and ontologies representing entities involved in the DPIA process can help data controllers determine the risk of their processing activities. Additionally, an inference engine, equipped with a knowledge base of DPIA-related obligations, can effectively assist data controllers in taking specific actions when a legal fact is triggered based on met conditions.

AB  - The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will become a legal requirement for all organizations in Europe from 25th May 2018 which collect and process data. One of the major changes detailed in Article 22 of the GDPR includes the rights of an individual not to be subject to automated decision-making, which includes profiling, unless explicit consent is given. Individuals who are subject to such decision-making have the right to ask for an explanation on how the decision is reached and organizations must utilize appropriate mathematics and statistical procedures. All data collected, including research projects require a privacy by design approach as well as the data controller to complete a Data Protection Impact Assessment in addition to gaining ethical approval. This paper discusses the impact of the GDPR on research projects which contain elements of computational intelligence undertaken within a University or with an Academic Partner.

AB  - Privacy and Data protection are highly complex issues within eHealth/M-Health systems. These systems should meet specific requirements deriving from the organizations and users, as well as from the variety of legal obligations deriving from GDPR that dictate protection rights of data subjects and responsibilities of data controllers. To address that, this paper proposes a Privacy and Data Protection Framework that provides the appropriate steps so as the proper technical, organizational and procedural measures to be undertaken. The framework, beyond previous literature, supports the combination of privacy by design principles with the newly introduced GDPR requirements in order to create a strong elicitation process for deriving the set of the technical security and privacy requirements that should be addressed. It also proposes a process for validating that the elicited requirements are indeed fulfilling the objectives addressed during the Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), carried out according to the GDPR.

AB  - The use of algorithms in modern data processing techniques, as well as data-intensive technological trends, suggests the adoption of a broader view of the data protection impact assessment. This will force data controllers to go beyond the traditional focus on data quality and security, and consider the impact of data processing on fundamental rights and collective social and ethical values.
   Building on studies of the collective dimension of data protection, this article sets out to embed this new perspective in an assessment model centred on human rights (Human Rights, Ethical and Social Impact Assessment-HRESIA). This self-assessment model intends to overcome the limitations of the existing assessment models, which are either too closely focused on data processing or have an extent and granularity that make them too complicated to evaluate the consequences of a given use of data.
   In terms of architecture, the HRESIA has two main elements: a self-assessment questionnaire and an ad hoc expert committee. As a blueprint, this contribution focuses mainly on the nature of the proposed model, its architecture and its challenges; a more detailed description of the model and the content of the questionnaire will be discussed in a future publication drawing on the ongoing research.

AB  - As modern web browsers gain new and increasingly powerful features the importance of impact assessments of the new functionality becomes crucial.
   A web privacy impact assessment of a planned web browser feature, the Ambient Light Sensor API, indicated risks arising from the exposure of overly precise information about the lighting conditions in the user environment. The analysis led to the demonstration of direct risks of leaks of user data, such as the list of visited websites or exfiltration of sensitive content across distinct browser contexts.
   Our work contributed to the creation of web standards leading to decisions by browser vendors (i.e. obsolescence, non-implementation or modification to the operation of browser features). We highlight the need to consider broad risks when making reviews of new features. We offer practically-driven high-level observations lying on the intersection of web security and privacy risk engineering and modeling, and standardization. We structure our work as a case study from activities spanning over three years.

AB  - This work answers the following question, how to gather and act on personal data in smart city projects using boundary objects? Smart city projects require new mapping methods so they can share and discuss work collectively. Working collectively is necessary because smart city projects are difficult to map in one singular view for personal data because different smart city stakeholders have a part of the required information. Summarising data processing operations is most often taken for granted and under-defined in Data Protection Impact Assessment methods.
   This paper is a plea for the use of boundary objects for GDPR compliance and research in smart cities. Therefore, this article is a comparison of the original context boundary objects with the context of smart cities to illustrate the need for a similar approach. The main results of this paper point to a new approach to enable collaborative GDPR compliance where specialist knowledge trickles down to developers and other actors not educated to comply with GDPR requirements.

AB  - Advances in artificial intelligence, smart sensors, data mining, and other fields of ICT have resulted in a plethora of research projects aimed at harnessing these technologies, for example to generate new knowledge about diseases, to develop systems for better management of chronic diseases, and to assist the elderly with independent living. While the algorithms themselves can be developed using anonymized or synthetic data, conducting a pilot study is often one of the key components of a research project, and such studies unavoidably involve actual users with their personal data. Although one of the derogations stipulated in Article 89 of the GDPR is related to the data processed for scientific purposes, the GDPR still is applicable to that processing in a broader interpretation. The computer scientists and engineers working in research projects may not always be fully familiar with all the details of the GDPR, a close collaboration with a lawyer specialized in the European data protection legislation is highly beneficial for the success of a project. In this paper, we consider a hypothetical research project developed by an engineer dealing with sensitive personal data and a lawyer conducting Data Protection Impact Assessment to ensure legality and quality of the research project.

AB  - This paper reassess the evaluation of ethical, legal and social issues (ELSI) in relation to the agile development of information systems in the domain of crisis management. The authors analyse the differing assessment needs of a move from a traditional approach to the development of information systems to an agile approach, which offers flexibility, adaptability and responds to the needs of users as the system develops. In turn, the authors argue that this development requires greater flexibility and an iterative approach to assessing ELSI. The authors provide an example from the Horizon 2020 EU-funded project iTRACK (Integrated system for real-time TRACKing and collective intelligence in civilian humanitarian missions) to exemplify this move to an iterative approach in practice, drawing on the process of undertaking an ethical and privacy impact assessment for the purpose of this project.

LA  - English
AB  - In this chapter the authors present their information model implemented for one pilot developed in the "RFID from Farm to Fork" (F2F) project which looks for the extension of RFID technologies throughout the complete food chain. They describe the privacy assessment proposed by the European Union that allows the evaluation of the privacy and security impact for a RFID application under study. The main privacy risks have been identified and described by the related EU Directives concerning RFID technology. The authors describe the questionnaire elaborated by the EU to assess the privacy robustness level of a RFID application, and they showcase a real wine pilot deployed in Spain. In this chapter, the authors also examine the privacy risks in the middleware communication with both RFID reader and back-end system. The EPCIS has been the Open Source middleware solution adopted in the F2F project. For the F2F pilot deployed in the wine sector, the authors describe the privacy impact assessment questionnaire designed for this case. Finally, they discuss the threads on the RFID tags, the advantages provided by the WISP technology in this regard and its repercussion on the risk questionnaire.

AB  - Addressing cyber and privacy risks has never been more critical for organisations. While a number of risk assessment methodologies and software tools are available, it is most often the case that one must, at least, integrate them into a holistic approach that combines several appropriate risk sources as input to risk mitigation tools. In addition, cyber risk assessment primarily investigates cyber risks as the consequence of vulnerabilities and threats that threaten assets of the investigated infrastructure. In fact, cyber risk assessment is decoupled from privacy impact assessment, which aims to detect privacy-specific threats and assess the degree of compliance with data protection legislation. Furthermore, a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) is conducted in a proactive manner during the design phase of a system, combining processing activities and their inter-dependencies with assets, vulnerabilities, real-time threats and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that may occur during the dynamic life-cycle of systems. In this paper, we propose a cyber and privacy risk management toolkit, called AMBIENT (Automated Cyber and Privacy Risk Management Toolkit) that addresses the above challenges by implementing and integrating three distinct software tools. AMBIENT not only assesses cyber and privacy risks in a thorough and automated manner but it also offers decision-support capabilities, to recommend optimal safeguards using the well-known repository of the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Controls. To the best of our knowledge, AMBIENT is the first toolkit in the academic literature that brings together the aforementioned capabilities. To demonstrate its use, we have created a case scenario based on information about cyber attacks we have received from a healthcare organisation, as a reference sector that faces critical cyber and privacy threats.

AB  - Technological advancements allow biometric applications to be more omnipresent than in any other time before. This paper argues that in the current EU data protection regulation, classification applications using biometric data receive less protection compared to biometric recognition. We analyse preconditions in the regulatory language and explore how this has the potential to be the source of unique privacy risks for processing operations classifying individuals based on soft traits like emotions. This can have high impact on personal freedoms and human rights and, therefore, should be subject to data protection impact assessment.

AB  - Introduction In Europe, alcohol consumption is responsible for many diseases, disabilities, injuries and premature deaths. In France, alcohol consumption represents an important health burden, due to its frequency, scale and the serious damage it causes. One of the keys to addressing the problem would appear to be the adoption of harm and risk reduction approaches. In order to operationalise this strategy, the Nouvelle Aquitaine Regional Health Agency is funding three different programmes to reduce the harm and risks associated with alcohol consumption: Alcochoix, Iaca and ETP (Education Therapeutique du Patient) Conso-repere. We are interested in understanding how, under what circumstances, through which mechanisms and for which population the different programmes work. Methods and analysis The ECIAE study (a cross-evaluation of the 3 programs Iaca/Alcochoix/ ETP (Patient Therapeutic Education) is a theory-based evaluation where the realist evaluation method is used to explore effects, intervention mechanisms and the influence of context on outcomes. This realist evaluation is based on multiple case studies in two nested levels. At the first level, each centre implementing the programme will represent a case. At the second level, each programme will represent a case in which a set of activities is conducted to achieve risk reduction objectives. Ethics and dissemination The project will be carried out in full compliance with existing legislation and international conventions. It was subject to analysis, including a privacy impact assessment conducted by the Data Protection Officer of the University of Bordeaux. The University of Bordeaux has ensured that all the regulatory procedures related to the ECIAE study have been carried out. The dissemination plan includes scientific papers, seminars, a report and recommendation and a public restitution. The study will provide evidence-based results to help health authorities roll out strategies to reduce risks and harm associated with alcohol use.

AB  - IntroductionTraumatic injuries constitute a major cause of mortality and morbidity. Still, the public health burden of trauma in Norway has not been characterised using nationwide registry data. More knowledge is warranted on trauma risk factors and the long-term outcomes following trauma. The Injury Prevention and long-term Outcomes following Trauma project will establish a comprehensive research database. The Norwegian National Trauma Registry (NTR) will be merged with several data sources to pursue the following three main research topics: (1) the public health burden of trauma to society (eg, excess mortality and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs)), (2) trauma aetiology (eg, socioeconomic factors, comorbidity and drug use) and (3) trauma survivorship (eg, survival, drug use, use of welfare benefits, work ability, education and income).Methods and analysisThe NTR (n approximate to 27000 trauma patients, 2015-2018) will be coupled with the data from Statistics Norway, the Norwegian Patient Registry, the Cause of Death Registry, the Registry of Primary Health Care and the Norwegian Prescription Database. To quantify the public health burden, DALYs will be calculated from the NTR. To address trauma aetiology, we will conduct nested case-control studies with 10 trauma-free controls (drawn from the National Population Register) matched to each trauma case on birth year, sex and index date. Conditional logistic regression models will be used to estimate trauma risk according to relevant exposures.

TI  - TEACHING FAIRNESS TO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: EXISTING AND NOVEL STRATEGIES AGAINST ALGORITHMIC DISCRIMINATION UNDER EU LAW
T2  - COMMON MARKET LAW REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - Empirical evidence is mounting that artificial intelligence applications threaten to discriminate against legally protected groups. This raises intricate questions for EU law. The existing categories of EU anti-discrimination law do not provide an easy fit for algorithmic decision making. Furthermore, victims won't be able to prove their case without access to the data and the algorithmic models. Drawing on a growing computer science literature on algorithmic fairness, this article suggests an integrated vision of anti-discrimination and data protection law to enforce fairness in the digital age. It shows how the concepts of anti-discrimination law may be combined with algorithmic audits and data protection impact assessments in an effort to unlock the algorithmic black box.

AB  - The content-based publish/subscribe paradigm enables a loosely-coupled and expressive form of communication. However, privacy preservation remains a challenge for distributed event-based middleware especially since encrypted matching incurs significant computing overhead. This paper adapts an existing attribute-based encryption scheme and combines it with data splitting, a non-cryptographic method called for alleviating the cost of encrypted matching. Data splitting enables to form groups of attributes that are sent apart over several independent broker networks so that it prevents the identification of an end-user; and, only identifying attributes are encrypted to prevent data leakage. The goal is to achieve an acceptable privacy level at an affordable computing price by encrypting only the necessary attributes, whose selection is determined through a Privacy Impact Assessment.

TI  - The EU Digital COVID Certificate: A Preliminary Data Protection Impact Assessment
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RISK REGULATION
LA  - English
AB  - On 20 May 2021, the European Commission, Council and Parliament announced a breakthrough in the trialogue negotiations to establish the European Union (EU) Digital COVID Certificate. Originally, this standardisation effort was labelled as "Digital Green Certificate" and - "[i]n view of the urgency" - presented without a data protection impact assessment. It should allow citizens and residents of Member States to prove that they are either vaccinated against COVID-19, have recently tested negative or are currently immune against the virus. This article considers the proposal from a privacy perspective, taking into account the opinion of EU data protection authorities, ongoing negotiations in the EU institutions and relevant developments on the national and international level. While the European Parliament and others tried to improve the original Commission proposal, questions around the appropriateness and effectiveness of the framework remain. The technological and organisational implementation is essentially left to Member States, who already have started to develop their own tracing and identification systems.

AB  - It is important to analyse the privacy impact of Intrusion Detection System (IDS) rules, in order to understand and quantify the privacy-invasiveness of network monitoring services. The objective in this paper is to classify Snort rules according to the risk of privacy violations in the form of leaking sensitive or confidential material. The classification is based on a ruleset that formerly has been manually categorised according to our PRIvacy LEakage (PRILE) methodology. Such information can be useful both for privacy impact assessments and automated tests for detecting privacy violations. Information about potentially privacy violating rules can subsequently be used to tune the IDS rule sets, with the objective to minimise the expected amount of data privacy violations during normal operation. The paper suggests some classification tasks that can be useful both to improve the PRILE methodology and for privacy violation evaluation tools. Finally, two selected classification tasks are analysed by using a Naive Bayes classifier.

AB  - Although decoding the content of mental states is currently unachievable, technologies such as neural interfaces, affective computing systems, and digital behavioral technologies enable increasingly reliable statistical associations between certain data patterns and mental activities such as memories, intentions, and emotions. Furthermore, Artificial Intelligence enables the exploration of these activities not just retrospectively but also in a real-time and predictive manner. In this article, we introduce the notion of 'mental data', defined as any data that can be organized and processed to make inferences about the mental states of a person, including their cognitive, affective and conative states. Further, we analyze existing legal protections for mental data by considering the lawfulness of their processing in light of different legal bases and purposes, with special focus on the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We argue that the GDPR is an adequate tool to mitigate risks related to mental data processing. However, we recommend that interpreters focus on processing characteristics, rather than merely on the category of data at issue. Finally, we call for a 'Mental Data Protection Impact Assessment', a specific data protection impact assessment designed to better assess and mitigate the risks to fundamental rights and freedoms associated with the processing of mental data.

AB  - Cloud computing (CC) has the potential to provide significant benefits to healthcare organizations; however, its susceptibility to security and privacy apprehensions needs to be addressed before its adoption. It is important to evaluate the risks that arise from CC prior to its adoption in healthcare projects. Failure to evaluate security and privacy concerns could result in regulatory penalties, reputation loss, financial issues, and public loss of confidence in the healthcare provider. This paper uses Alberta's Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) requirement and COBIT 5 for Risk as guidance to highlight CC risk assessment areas and presents an IT governance and risk mitigation approach useful for CC adoption in the healthcare industry. In compliance with Alberta's Health Information Act (HIA), the risk assessment areas are analyzed based on the security triad with emphasis on the confidentiality principle where privacy is the main focus. The proposed approach presented in this paper can be utilized by healthcare providers to mitigate and continuously evaluate CC risks from an IT governance perspective. Although the case study uses Canadian regulations, similar considerations can be taken into account in other jurisdictions.

AB  - Impact assessments have received particular attention on both sides of the Atlantic as a tool for implementing algorithmic accountability. The aim of this paper is to address how Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) (Art. 35) in the European Union (EU)'s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) link the GDPR's two approaches to algorithmic accountability-individual rights and systemic governance-and potentially lead to more accountable and explainable algorithms. We argue that algorithmic explanation should not be understood as a static statement, but as a circular and multi-layered transparency process based on several layers (general information about an algorithm, group-based explanations, and legal justification of individual decisions taken). We argue that the impact assessment process plays a crucial role in connecting internal company heuristics and risk mitigation to outward-facing rights, and in forming the substance of several kinds of explanations.

CP  - 6th Annual Conference on Privacy, Security and Trust
AB  - Canadian government bodies are subject to a number of requirements, including legislation, regulations, directives and policies, that speaks to informational privacy. These have come to be considered synonymous with the completion of a Privacy Impact Assessment. Some go so far as to specifically require an assessment, but few speak to specific technical content. Nor are there. process requirements for sustaining privacy standards once the assessment document is submitted. At best, recommendations are identified to enhance the privacy posture of a program area's information management practices, but there is no mechanism to ensure that they are implemented.
   We propose the PIA process be adapted to mandate privacy outcomes in terms of specific actions that must be taken once the assessment is complete. Starting with the established PIA document, the program area can identify how to best marry the privacy requirements with the established business processes supporting the service delivery line. The result would incorporate privacy Outcomes as ongoing activities and include not only consideration of agency requirements for personal information management, but also the impact to an individual's informational privacy.

AB  - The development of automated decision-making technologies creates the threat of de-iuridification: replacement of the legal acts' provisions with automated, technological solutions. The article examines how selected provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation concerning, among other things, data protection impact assessments, the right to not be subject to automated decision-making, information obligations and the right to access are applied in the Polish national legal order. We focus on the institutional and procedural solutions regarding the involvement of expert bodies and other stakeholders in the process of specification of the norms included in the GDPR and their enforcement. We argue that the example of Poland shows that the solutions adopted in the GDPR do not shift the balance concerning regulatory power in regard to automated decision-making to other stakeholders and as such do not favor of a more participative approach to the regulatory processes.

AB  - For years, privacy regulators have said that privacy is good for business. Strong privacy management programs and accountability mechanisms build trust with consumers. In the public sector, privacy regulators have seen massive information sharing projects fail when public input or consultation, or independent oversight is not considered. After a sequence of events in 2018, society as a whole began asking questions about what is being done with personal information and questioned whether it is in our best interests. This presentation made at the University of Alberta's Kule Institute's event on "AI, Ethics and Society" in May 2019 provides an overview of the shifts that have taken place and how privacy regulators internationally have incorporated discussions about ethical assessments, in addition to traditional privacy impact assessments, as a way to guide current and future tech developments involving personal information in a way that is legal, fair and just.

AB  - The General Data Protection Regulation has propelled privacy to an equal requirement with security for data protection. A key regulation requirement is data protection by design and a corresponding data protection impact assessment that details security and privacy by design for a project processing data. Security and privacy of data in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) handles sensitive health data and accordingly is bound by additional regulatory safety, security and privacy requirements. Health data in the IoMT can potentially flow through a diversity of apps, systems, devices and technologies, open networks. This exposes the transmitted data in the IoMT to additional attack surfaces and consequently increases on the need for security and privacy. Applying security and privacy regulatory requirements is a struggle for developers in small to medium enterprises due to a lack of knowledge, understanding, training, experience and financial constraints. This paper proposes a framework aimed at developers in small to medium enterprises, to assist in meeting regulatory requirements for security and privacy of data in flow in the IoMT. This framework expands on the basic established threat modeling steps to apply both security and privacy properties to protect data in flow in the IoMT. The framework includes a set of categorised technical security and privacy controls developed through medical device security standards to mitigate identified security and privacy threats. This framework also provides a foundation for the administration of a data protection impact assessment.

AB  - Smart devices have become ubiquitous in everyday life, and it is commonplace that migrants are among the users of connected tools. With the realization that migrants rely on connectivity for multiple purposes, including to access information and services, many initiatives started working on developing ICT tools to assist migrants to integrate into their new society. Technological tools, however, come with inherent risks, many of which are linked to the processing of personal data of their users. This is especially true for migrants, who are often vulnerable due to their migration status, which is not always secure in the host country. To mitigate these risks, we argue that an expanded data protection impact assessment, analyzing not only the impacts related to data protection, but also to the specific situation of migrants, should be conducted at the outset of any technology development project to influence the development of safe and reliable ICT tools for this target population. A practical example of the application of such an assessment is provided, based on the authors' experience as legal advisors in the REBUILD project, which is one of the current initiatives in the EU aiming to develop ICT tools for migrant integration.

AB  - Data protection impact assessments (DPIAs) aim to identify, rank, and mitigate privacy risks. Even though DPIAs are legally mandated in some cases and privacy professionals perform DPIAs on a daily basis, facilitating the systematic measurement of privacy risks is an open problem. Research on privacy risk measurement often does not take into account the practical needs and requirements for DPIAs in real organizations. In this article, we fill this gap by reporting on focus groupswe held with a diverse group of privacy professionals. Through thematic analysis, we identify three themes that emerged from the focus groups: (a) how privacy in the contemporary society affects privacy risk assessment; (b) current practices and procedures in privacy risk assessment; and (c) common issues and challenges. Based on these themes, we identify future research directions for privacy risk measurement. Our article can help to ground research on privacy riskmeasurement in practical challenges faced by privacy professionals.

AB  - The newgeneral data protection regulation requires organizations to conduct a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) when the processing of personal information may result in high risk to individual rights and freedoms. DPIA allows organizations to identify, assess and prioritize the risks related to the processing of personal information and select suitable mitigations to reduce the severity of the risks. The existing DPIA methodologies measure the severity of privacy risks according to analysts' opinions about the likelihood and the impact factors of the threats. The assessment is therefore subjective to the expertise of the analysts. To reduce subjectivity, we propose a set of well-defined criteria that analysts can use to measure the likelihood and the impact of a privacy risk. Then, we adopt the fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making approach to systematically measure the severity of privacy risks while modeling the imprecision and vagueness inherent in linguistic assessment. Our approach is illustrated for a realistic scenario with respect to LINDDUN threat categories.

AB  - Purpose This study aims to investigate the development of adolescents' advertising literacy and privacy protection strategies in the context of targeted advertisements on social networking sites (SNSs). Design/methodology/approach A survey was conducted among 374 adolescents between 12 and 17 years of age, and 469 young adults (18-25 years) served as a comparative benchmark. Findings Results indicate that advertising literacy increases progressively throughout adolescence, and reaches adult-like levels only by the age of 16. In addition, adolescents have an inadequate awareness of commercial data collection practices. This awareness slowly increases as a function of their age until it reaches an adult level around the age of 20. Finally, findings reveal that adolescents take little action to cope with targeted advertisements by means of privacy protection strategies. Practical implications This paper devotes much attention to the formulation of specific recommendations for EU policymakers and regulatory bodies. In addition, it also holds implications for advertisers (e.g. the need for more in-depth data protection impact assessments), social media providers (e.g. adolescent-friendly privacy policy) and social caretakers (e.g. achieving advertising literacy and privacy education). Originality/value This paper fulfills the need to investigate adolescents' advertising literacy and privacy-protective behaviors on SNSs, and, in turn, directly translates these insights into recommendations that can underpin the rationale of regulatory or policy decisions on a European level.

AB  - The IoT is innovative and important phenomenon prone to several services ad applications, but it should consider the legal issues related to the data protection law.
   However, should be taken into account the legal issues related to the data protection and privacy law. Technological solutions are welcome, but it is necessary, before developing applications, to consider the risks which we cannot dismiss. Personal data is a value. In this context is fundamental to evaluate the legal issues and prevent them, adopting in each project the privacy by design approach. Regarding the privacy and security risks, there are some issues with potential consequences for data security and liability. The IoT system allows us to transfer data on the Internet, including personal data. In this context, it is important to consider the new European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - already in force from 24 May 2016 - that will be applicable on 25 May 2018. The GDPR introduces Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), data breach notification and very hard administrative fines in respect of infringements of the Regulation. A correct law analysis allows evaluating risks preventing the wrong use of personal data.
   The IoT ecosystem is evolving quickly, developing several applications in different sectors. The main topics for the last time are Big Data and the blockchain. People are paying attention to the latest one because of its potential concrete use for services and applications, increasing the security measures to guarantee a secure system. However, it is equally important to analyse the legal issues related to them. Everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her. In this context, we cannot dismiss to guarantee an adequate protection of personal data designing any application. The contribution describes the main legal issues related to privacy and data protection especially regarding the blockchain, focusing on the Privacy by Design approach, according to the GDPR. Furthermore, I resolutely believe that is possible to develop a worldwide privacy standard framework that organisations can use for their data protection activities.

AB  - The introduction of the Payment Service Directive (PSD2) has accelerated financial services and open banking growth. Deploying appropriate identity management solutions is crucial. This implies the adoption of secure protocols for authentication and authorization, such as OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0. The PSD2 also requires the application of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) when transactions involve personal data. In turn, the GDPR mandates a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) for assessing risks posed to data subjects' rights and freedom. This is a time-consuming and challenging task requiring heterogeneous skills that include the knowledge of best practices for deploying protocols, security mechanisms adopted by available identity management providers, and the capability to perform careful what-if analysis of the possible alternatives. To assist users in this task, we propose a methodology based on the formalization of the what-if analysis as an optimization problem that available tools can solve. The formalization is derived from the OAuth 2.0 and OpenID connects standards, security best practices to mitigate threats, and thorough the evaluation of 19 identity management providers to check their supported features concerning the identified set of features for OAuth/OIDC solutions. We apply the methodology to assist controllers and identify the most appropriate security setup to drive the process of making financial services compliant with the PSD2.

AB  - Purpose - Offshoring is a common practice to operationalize global business strategies. Data protection and privacy assurance are major concerns in such international arrangements. This paper aims to examine the strategy adopted to ensure privacy assurance in offshoring arrangements.
   Design/methodology/approach - This is a literature review to understand privacy assurance strategies adopted in offshoring arrangements and an exploratory case study of captive offshoring arrangement with onshore location in Canada and offshoring locations in India and Philippines. A comparative analysis of the privacy laws and privacy principles of Canada, Philippines and India has been done.
   Findings - It was found that at the time of migration of process or work to the offshore location, organizations follow a conformist privacy strategy; however, once in business as usual mode, they follow entrepreneur privacy strategy. Privacy impact assessment (PIA) was found to be an important element in resolving the "administrative problem" of an offshoring organization's privacy assurance strategy.
   Research limitations/implications - The core privacy principles are outlined in the PIA templates; however, the current templates are designed to meet the conformist strategy and may need to be revised to include the cultural aspects, training, audit and information security requirements to plan and deliver on the entrepreneur strategy.
   Practical implications - Offshoring organizations can benefit by planning for entrepreneur privacy assurance strategy at the inception stage. Enhancements to PIA templates to facilitate the same have been suggested.
   Originality/value - Privacy assurance strategy followed by organizations while offshoring has been examined. This paper suggests extending the PIA process so that it covers privacy assurance requirements in offshoring arrangements. The learnings can be used in managing privacy assurance requirements in similar multi-country offshore arrangements.

AB  - Nowadays, information systems are evolving towards increasingly interconnected, smart, and self-adaptive models. This transformation has led to the representation of the systems themselves in terms of natural ecosystems. Similar to the natural environment, the virtual world can be threatened by specific forms of pollution, such as illegitimate access to the system, unwanted changes to data, and loss of information, which affect the only resource it possesses, i.e., data. In order to provide proactive protection of data integrity and confidentiality, in this paper we consider the well-known principles of privacy by design and privacy by default in the design phase of system development. To this end, we propose an approach based on axiomatic design, which allows us to implement these two principles through an appropriate reinterpretation of the information axiom, in terms of privacy impact assessment. We illustrate our approach by a case study, which implements the process of managing patients in home care. However, the proposed method can be applied to processing systems that provide services. The main result achieved is to select the most digitally sustainable design solution, i.e., the one that best prevents the threats mentioned above.

CP  - 1st IEEE International Conference on RFID
AB  - New applications for Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology include embedding transponders in everyday things used by individuals, such as books, payment cards, and personal identification. While RFID technology has existed for decades, these new applications carry with them substantial new privacy and security risks for individuals. These risks arise due to a combination of aspects involved in these applications: 1) The transponders are permanently embedded in objects individuals commonly carry with them 2) Static data linkable to an individual is stored on these transponders 3) The objects these transponders are embedded in are used in public places where individuals have limited control over who can access data on the transponder. In 2002, the U.S. Department of State proposed the adoption of an "electronic passport," which embedded RFID transponders into U.S. passports for identification and document security purposes. In this paper, we use the U.S. Government's adoption process for the electronic passport as a case study for identifying the privacy and security risks that arise by embedding RFID technology in "everyday things." We discuss the reasons why the Department of State did not adequately identify and address these privacy and security risks, even after the government's process mandated a privacy impact assessment. We conclude with recommendations to assist government as well as industry in early identification and resolution of relevant risks posed by RFID technology embedded in everyday things.

AB  - In the public debate, social implications of information technology are mainly seen through the privacy lens. Impact assessments of information technology are also often limited to privacy impact assessments, which are focused on individual rights and well-being, as opposed to the social environment. In this article, I argue that this perspective is too narrow, in terms of understanding the complexity of the relation between information technology and society, as well as in terms of directions for managing this relation. I use systems theory to show that current approaches focus mostly on individual impact of information technology developments rather than their mediating role in society itself. I argue that this should be complemented by an analysis of impact on individuals (psychic systems) via co-construction of the environment (social system). I then take up the question of what the role of information technology in social systems would look like in terms of the social relations of trust and power, and how this can complement privacy in discussions on impacts of information technology.

AB  - The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) encourages the use of Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) to integrate privacy into organisations' activities and practices from early design onwards. To date, however, there has been little prescription about how Security & Privacy Requirements Engineering processes map to the necessary activities of a DPIA, and how these activities can be tool-supported. To address this problem, we present a tool-supported process for undertaking DPIAs using existing Requirements Engineering approaches and the CAIRIS platform. We illustrate this process using a real-world case study example where it was used to elicit privacy risks for a prototype medical application to support chemotherapy treatment.

AB  - In this work we investigate which aspects of data protection regulation must be carefully observed when implementing Blockchain-based projects in smart cities. This technology provides interesting properties and allows governments to develop flexible and innovative data management systems. Nevertheless, realizing the benefits of using Blockchains requires understanding the government processes along with the legal framework and political setting imposed on government. Though it is a buzzword, Blockchain may not always be the best solution for data processing, and carrying out a Data Protection Impact Assessment could allow an analysis of the necessity and proportionality of the mechanism. Furthermore, principles relating to security of data remain applicable to Blockchains. We discuss points of interaction between Blockchain technology and the European Union data protection framework, and provide recommendations on how to better develop Blockchain-based projects in smart cities. The findings of the study should provide public sector actors with a guideline to assess the real necessity and better format of a Blockchain-based application.

AB  - For companies that develop and operate IT applications that process the personal data of customers and employees, a major problem is protecting these data and preventing privacy breaches. Failure to adequately address this problem can result in considerable damage to the company's reputation and finances, as well as negative effects for customers or employees (data subjects). To address this problem, we propose a methodology that systematically considers privacy issues by using a step-by-step privacy impact assessment (PIA). Existing PIA approaches cannot be applied easily because they are improperly structured or imprecise and lengthy. We argue that companies that employ our PIA can achieve 'privacy-by-design', which is widely heralded by data protection authorities. In fact, the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) ratified the approach we present in this article for the technical field of RFID and published it as a guideline in November 2011. The contribution of the artefacts we created is twofold: First, we provide a formal problem representation structure for the analysis of privacy requirements. Second, we reduce the complexity of the privacy regulation landscape for practitioners who need to make privacy management decisions for their IT applications.

AB  - Although the protection of personal data is harmonized within the EU by Directive 95/46/EC and will be further harmonized by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2018, there are significant differences in the ways in which EU member states implemented the protection of privacy and personal data in national laws, policies, and practices. This paper presents the main findings of a research project that compares the protection of privacy and personal data in eight EU member states: France, Germany, the UK, Ireland, Romania, Italy, Sweden, and the Netherlands. The comparison focuses on five major themes: awareness and trust, government policies for personal data protection, the applicable laws and regulations, implementation of those laws and regulations, and supervision and enforcement.
   The comparison of privacy and data protection regimes across the EU shows some remarkable findings, revealing which countries are frontrunners and which countries are lagging behind on specific aspects. For instance, the roles of and interplay between governments, civil rights organizations, and data protections authorities vary from country to country. Furthermore, with regard to privacy and data protection there are differences in the intensity and scope of political debates, information campaigns, media attention, and public debate. New concepts like privacy impact assessments, privacy by design, data breach notifications and big data are on the agenda in some but not in all countries. Significant differences exist in (the levels of) enforcement by the different data protection authorities, due to different legal competencies, available budgets and personnel, policies, and cultural factors.

AB  - Privacy is receiving increased attention from both consumers, who are concerned about how they are being tracked and profiled, and regulators, who are introducing stronger penalties and encouragements for organizations to comply with legislation and to carry out Privacy Impact Assessments (PI As). These concerns are strengthened as usage of internet services, cloud computing and social networking spread. Therefore companies have to take privacy requirements into account just as they previously had to do this for security. While security mechanisms are relatively mature, system and product developers are not often provided with concrete suggestions from a privacy angle. This can be a problem because developers do not usually possess privacy expertise. In this paper we argue that it would be useful to move beyond current best practice - where a set of searchable privacy guidelines may be provided to developers - to automated support to software developers in early phases of software development. Specifically, our proposal is a decision support system for design for privacy focused on privacy by policy, to be integrated into the development environment. We have implemented a proof of concept and are extending this work to incorporate state-of-the art consent mechanisms derived from the EnCoRe (Ensuring Consent and Revocation) project [1].

AB  - The IoT is innovative and important phenomenon prone to several services and applications such as the blockchain, but it should consider the legal issues related to the data protection law. We should be taken into account the legal issues related to the data protection and privacy law. Technological solutions are welcome, but it is necessary, before developing applications, to consider the risks which we cannot dismiss. Personal data is a value. It is important to evaluate the European Regulation n. 679/2016, European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that will enter into force on 25 May 2018. The GDPR introduces Data Protection by Design and by Default, Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), data breach notification and significant administrative fines in respect of infringements of the Regulation. It is fundamental to evaluate the legal issues and prevent them, adopting in each project the Data Protection by Design approach. Regarding the data protection and security risks, there are some issues with potential consequences for data and liability. A correct law analysis allows evaluating risks preventing the wrong use of personal data. The contribution describes the main legal issues related to privacy and data protection focusing on the Privacy by Design approach, according to the GDPR.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the need for new ways of thinking about data protection. This is especially so in the case of health research with children. The responsible use of children's data plays a key role in promoting children's well-being and securing their right to health and to privacy. In this article, we contend that a contextual approach that appropriately balances children's legal and moral rights and interests is needed when thinking about data protection issues with children. We examine three issues in health research through a child-focused lens: consent to data processing, data retention, and data protection impact assessments. We show that these issues present distinctive concerns for children and that the General Data Protection Regulation provides few bright-line rules. We contend that there is an opportunity for creative approaches to children's data protection when child-specific principles, such as the best interests of the child and the child's right to be heard, are put into dialogue with the structure and logic of data protection law.

AB  - It is increasingly recognised that Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) play a crucial role in providing privacy protection for data subjects and in supporting risk management for organisations. However, existing PIA processes are typically not accompanied with proper guidelines and/or methodologies that sufficiently support privacy risk assessments and illustrate precisely how the core part of the PIA a risk assessment can be conducted. We present an approach for assessing potential privacy risks built upon a privacy risk model that considers legal, organisational, societal and technical aspects. This approach has the potential to underpin a systematic and traceable privacy risk-assessment methodology that can complement PIA processes.

AB  - Corpora of speech of individuals with communication disorders (CSD) are invaluable resources for education and research, but they are costly and hard to build and difficult to share for various reasons. DELAD, which means 'shared' in Swedish, is a project initiated by Professors Nicole Muller and Martin Ball in 2015 that aims to address this issue by establishing a platform for researchers to share datasets of speech disorders with interested audiences. To date four workshops have been held, where selected participants, covering various expertise including researchers in clinical phonetics and linguistics, speech and language therapy, infrastructure specialists, and ethics and legal specialists, participated to discuss relevant issues in setting up such an archive. Positive and steady progress has been made since 2015, including refurbishing the DELAD website (http://delad.net/) with information and application forms for researchers to join and share their datasets and linking with the CLARIN K-Centre for Atypical Communication Expertise (https://ace.ruhosting.nl/) where CSD can be hosted and accessed through the CLARIN B-Centres, The Language Archive (https://tla.mpi.nl/tools/tla-tools/) and TalkBank (https://talkbank.org/). The latest workshop, which was funded by CLARIN (Common Language Resources and Technology Infrastructure) was held as an online event in January 2021 on topics including Data Protection Impact Assessments, reviewing changes in ethics perspectives in academia on sharing CSD, and voice conversion as a mean to pseudonomise speech. This paper reports the latest progress of DELAD and discusses the directions for further advance of the initiative, with information on how researchers can contribute to the repository.

KW  - TAXONOMY
AB  - Any reasonable implementation of privacy requirements can not be made through legal compliance alone. The belief that a software system can be developed without privacy being an integral concept, or that a privacy policy is sufficient as requirements or compliance check is at best dangerous for the users, customers and business involved. While requirements frameworks exist, the specialisation of these into the privacy domain have not been made in such a manner that they unify both the legal and engineering domains. In order to achieve this one must develop ontological structures to aid communication between these domains, provide a commonly acceptable semantics and a framework by which requirements expressed at different levels of abstractness can be linked together and support refinement. An effect of this is to almost completely remove the terms 'personal data' and 'PII' from common usage and force a deeper understanding of the data and information being processed. Once such a structure is in place - even if just partially or sparsely populated - provides a formal framework by which not only requirements can be obtained, their application (or not) be justified and a proper risk analysis made. This has further advantages in that privacy requirements and their potential implementations can be explored through the software development process and support ideas such as agile methods and 'DevOps' rather than being an 'add-on' exercise - a privacy impact assessment - poorly executed at inappropriate times.

AB  - Discussion about vulnerable individuals and communities spread from research ethics to consumer law and human rights. According to many theoreticians and practitioners, the framework of vulnerability allows formulating an alternative language to articulate problems of inequality, power imbalances and social injustice. Building on this conceptualisation, we try to understand the role and potentiality of the notion of vulnerable data subjects. The starting point for this reflection is wide-ranging development, deployment and use of data-driven technologies that may pose substantial risks to human rights, the rule of law and social justice. Implementation of such technologies can lead to discrimination systematic marginalisation of different communities and the exploitation of people in particularly sensitive life situations. Considering those problems, we recognise the special role of personal data protection and call for its vulnerability-aware interpretation. This article makes three contributions. First, we examine how the notion of vulnerability is conceptualised and used in the philosophy, human rights and European law. We then confront those findings with the presence and interpretation of vulnerability in data protection law and discourse. Second, we identify two problematic dichotomies that emerge from the theoretical and practical application of this concept in data protection. Those dichotomies reflect the tensions within the definition and manifestation of vulnerability. To overcome limitations that arose from those two dichotomies we support the idea of layered vulnerability, which seems compatible with the GDPR and the risk-based approach. Finally, we outline how the notion of vulnerability can influence the interpretation of particular provisions in the GDPR. In this process, we focus on issues of consent, Data Protection Impact Assessment, the role of Data Protection Authorities, and the participation of data subjects in the decision making about data processing.

AB  - The presence of experts, such as a data protection officer (DPO) and a privacy engineer is essential in Privacy Requirements Engineering. This task is carried out in various forms including threat modeling and privacy impact assessment. The knowledge required for performing privacy threat modeling can be a serious challenge for a novice privacy engineer. We aim to bridge this gap by developing an automated approach via machine learning that is able to detect privacy-related entities in the user stories. The relevant entities include (1) the Data Subject, (2) the Processing, and (3) the Personal Data entities. We use a state-of-the-art Named Entity Recognition (NER) model along with contextual embedding techniques. We argue that an automated approach can assist agile teams in performing privacy requirements engineering techniques such as threat modeling, which requires a holistic understanding of how personally identifiable information is used in a system.

AB  - This has been a big year for privacy with so much going on within the EU regarding reform of data protection. What are the implications of reform here and what are the issues that concern us about the proposed new data protection regime contained in the proposed Regulation? We hear a lot about the 'right to be forgotten'. How is that possible in the digital age within the online world? And what can be done about the big players who stand charged with the erosion of privacy viz Facebook, Google, Skype & YouTube etc? How can the law keep up with technological change when the latter is moving so fast e.g. with RFID, Cloud and social networking? To what extent can data breach notification, net neutrality and privacy impact assessment help and how should the law approach issues of liability and criminality in relation to privacy? What is the state of play too in the relationship between privacy policy and state surveillance and, given its implications for privacy, what obligations should governments adopt in response to cybersecurity regulation and data management? Is there a place for privacy self-regulation and if so in what respects and how effective are the Information Commissioners who often complain of being under resourced? In reviewing the way privacy law has emerged do we now need a completely new approach to the whole issue? Has the law crept into its present form simply by default? Do we need some new thinking now that reflects the fact that law is only one dimension in the battle for privacy? If so what are the other factors we need to recognise? (C) 2012 Steve Saxby.

AB  - Social media data are being increasingly used in conservation science to study human-nature interactions. User-generated content, such as images, video, text, and audio, and the associated metadata can be used to assess such interactions. A number of social media platforms provide free access to user-generated social media content. However, similar to any research involving people, scientific investigations based on social media data require compliance with highest standards of data privacy and data protection, even when data are publicly available. Should social media data be misused, the risks to individual users' privacy and well-being can be substantial. We investigated the legal basis for using social media data while ensuring data subjects' rights through a case study based on the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation. The risks associated with using social media data in research include accidental and purposeful misidentification that has the potential to cause psychological or physical harm to an identified person. To collect, store, protect, share, and manage social media data in a way that prevents potential risks to users involved, one should minimize data, anonymize data, and follow strict data management procedure. Risk-based approaches, such as a data privacy impact assessment, can be used to identify and minimize privacy risks to social media users, to demonstrate accountability and to comply with data protection legislation. We recommend that conservation scientists carefully consider our recommendations in devising their research objectives so as to facilitate responsible use of social media data in conservation science research, for example, in conservation culturomics and investigations of illegal wildlife trade online.

AB  - Purpose
   This study aims to assist organizations to protect the privacy of their users and the security of the data that they store and process. Users may be the customers of the organization (people using the offered services) or the employees (users who operate the systems of the organization). To be more specific, this paper proposes a privacy impact assessment (PIA) method that explicitly takes into account the organizational characteristics and employs a list of well-defined metrics as input, demonstrating its applicability to two hospital information systems with different characteristics.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This paper presents a PIA method that employs metrics and takes into account the peculiarities and other characteristics of the organization. The applicability of the method has been demonstrated on two Hospital Information Systems with different characteristics. The aim is to assist the organizations to estimate the criticality of potential privacy breaches and, thus, to select the appropriate security measures for the protection of the data that they collect, process and store.
   Findings
   The results of the proposed PIA method highlight the criticality of each privacy principle for every data set maintained by the organization. The method employed for the calculation of the criticality level, takes into account the consequences that the organization may experience in case of a security or privacy violation incident on a specific data set, the weighting of each privacy principle and the unique characteristics of each organization. So, the results of the proposed PIA method offer a strong indication of the security measures and privacy enforcement mechanisms that the organization should adopt to effectively protect its data.
   Originality/value
   The novelty of the method is that it handles security and privacy requirements simultaneously, as it uses the results of risk analysis together with those of a PIA. A further novelty of the method is that it introduces metrics for the quantification of the requirements and also that it takes into account the specific characteristics of the organization.

AB  - center dot The application of artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed the existing notion of the health care system. The concept of AI is not new, but increasing computational power and big data, the Internet of Things, and advanced analytical power ushers in new opportunities to realize the full potential of AI. Recently, there has been an increased application of AI in the health care system, potentially raising questions about patient safety, privacy, security, and confidentiality, specifically data protection. center dot The present study focuses on the effectiveness of the Malaysian data protection law in addressing the issue of health data protection in the wake of proliferated use of AI in the health care system. The Malaysian Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) has to face challenges in applying AI because the data processing mechanism of AI has fundamentally challenged the adequacy and sustainability of present data protection principles and associated rights of individuals. center dot However, as nearly a decade-old law, the current PDPA requires some amendments to its provisions, for instance, the introduction of the mandatory requirement of data protection impact assessment and privacy by design for high-risk data (ie health data) processing and human involvement in automated decision-making process among others. Besides, ensuring more accountability and transparency on the part of the data users by introducing a comprehensive code of practice about the processing of health data would help data users comply with data protection legislation.

AB  - Identification and authentication (IA) are security procedures that are ubiquitous in our online life, and that constantly require disclosing personal, sensitive information to non-fully trusted service providers, or to fully trusted providers that unintentionally may fail to protect such information. Although user IA processes are extensively supported by heterogeneous software and hardware, the simultaneous protection of user privacy is an open problem.
   From a legal point of view, the European Union legislation requires protecting the processing of personal data and evaluating its impact on privacy throughout the whole IA procedure. Privacy Threat Analysis (PTA) is one of the pillars for the required Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA). amongst the few existing approaches for conducting a PTA, LINDDUN is a very promising framework, although generic, in the sense that it has not been specifically conceived for IA.
   In this work, we investigate an extension of LINDDUN that allows performing a reliable and systematically-reproducible PTA of user IA processes, thereby contributing to one of the cornerstones of PIA. Specifically, we propose a high-level description of the IA verification process, which we illustrate with an UML use case. Then, we design an identification and authentication modelling framework, propose an extension of two critical steps of the LINDDUN scheme, and adapt and tailor the trust boundary concept applied in the original framework. Finally, we propose a systematic methodology aimed to help auditors apply the proposed improvements to the LINDDUN framework. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Community Health Workers (CHWs) have been using Mobile Health Data Collection Systems (MDCSs) for supporting the delivery of primary healthcare and carrying out public health surveys, feeding national-level databases with families' personal data. Such systems are used for public surveillance and to manage sensitive data (i.e., health data), so addressing the privacy issues is crucial for successfully deploying MDCSs. In this paper we present a comprehensive privacy threat analysis for MDCSs, discuss the privacy challenges and provide recommendations that are specially useful to health managers and developers. We ground our analysis on a large-scale MDCS used for primary care (GeoHealth) and a well-known Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) methodology. The threat analysis is based on a compilation of relevant privacy threats from the literature as well as brainstorming sessions with privacy and security experts. Among the main findings, we observe that existing MDCSs do not employ adequate controls for achieving transparency and interveinability. Thus, threatening fundamental privacy principles regarded as data quality, right to access and right to object. Furthermore, it is noticeable that although there has been significant research to deal with data security issues, the attention with privacy in its multiple dimensions is prominently lacking.

AB  - Background Consultations before and after bariatric surgery should include structured assessments of patients' health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and mental health. One way to conduct this assessment is to implement patient-reported outcome monitoring with a clinical feedback system (PRO/CFS).
   Aim We will explore patients' and healthcare professionals' experiences when a PRO/CFS is an integrated part of bariatric surgery care.
   Methods and analyses This is a design paper in which a PRO/CFS will be implemented in two bariatric outpatient clinics. All patients who have an appointment with a healthcare professional prior to, and 3 and 12 months after surgery, will be asked to complete six digital questionnaires measuring HRQOL, mental health, bowel symptoms and eating self-efficacy prior to each consultation. A digital summary report generated from the patient's responses will form the basis for the clinical consultation. A team of patient representatives, healthcare professionals and researchers will be involved in all phases of designing the PRO/CFS to ensure its relevance for clinical consultations. The patients' experiences will be explored with a generic 12-item questionnaire, developed for use in outpatient clinics, prior to and 12 months after bariatric surgery. We will conduct focus-group interviews with patients and healthcare professionals to explore their experiences when PRO/CFS is integrated into the consultations.
   Ethics and dissemination Written informed consent will be obtained for all participants in the study. The project is approved by the Norwegian Centre for Research Data, Department of Data Protection Services (ref. no. 282738). The project has also undergone Data Protection Impact Assessments, both at FOrde Hospital Trust and at St. Olav Hospital (registration no. 2016/3912). Data from the qualitative and quantitative studies will be kept in de-identified form in a secured research database, and the findings will be published in international peer-reviewed journals and presented at scientific conferences.

AB  - Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) play a crucial role in providing privacy protection for data subjects and supporting risk management. From an engineering perspective, the core of a PIA is a risk assessment, which typically follows a step-by-step process of risk identification and risk mitigation. In order for a PIA to be holistic and effective, it needs to be complemented by an appropriate privacy risk model that considers legal, organisational, societal and technical aspects. We propose a data-centric approach for identifying and analysing potential privacy risks in a comprehensive manner.

AB  - The first broad reform of personal data protection legislation in the European Union entered into force in May 2018 (Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the General Data Protection Regulation). Remarkably, with this reform a risk-based approach has been introduced as the core data protection enforcement model, while data protection authorities see their regulatory role significantly weakened. The risk-based approach is to be implemented by the data controllers (i.e. the operators) via data protection impact assessments (evoking the established environmental impact assessment procedure) and notification of breaches, among other procedures. Hence the scope of both the concepts of risk and risk regulation spread beyond conventional domains, namely the environment, public health or safety, i.e. physical risks, to encompass risks to intangible values, i.e. individual rights and freedoms, presumably harder to assess and manage. Strikingly, the reform has been accompanied by a confident discourse by EU institutions, and their avowed belief in the reform's ability to safeguard the fundamental right to data protection in the face of evolving data processing techniques, specifically, big data, the Internet of Things, and related algorithmic decision-making. However, one may wonder whether there isn't cause for concern in view of the way the risk-based approach has been designed in the data protection legislation. In this article, the risk-based approach to data protection is analysed in the light of the reform's underlying rationality. Comparison with the risk regulatory experience in environmental law, particularly the environmental impact assessment procedure, is drawn upon to assist us in pondering the shortcomings, as well as the opportunities of the novel risk-based approach.

AB  - The use of various forms of big data have revolutionised scientific research. This includes research in the field of genetics in areas ranging from medical research to anthropology. Developments in this area have inter alia been characterised by the ability to sequence genome wide sequences (GWS) cheaply, the ability to share and combine with other forms of complimentary data and ever more powerful processing techniques that have become possible given tremendous increases in computing power. Given that many if not most of these techniques will make use of personal data it is necessary to take into account data protection law. This article looks at challenges for researchers that will be presented by the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, which will be in effect from May 2018. The very nature of research with big data in general and genetic data in particular means that in many instances compliance will be onerous, whilst in others it may even be difficult to envisage how compliance may be possible. Compliance concerns include issues relating to 'purpose limitation', 'data minimisation' and 'storage limitation'. Other requirements, including the need to facilitate data subject rights and potentially conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) may provide further complications for researchers. Further critical issues to consider include the choice of legal base: whether to opt for what is often seen as the 'default option' (i.e. consent) or to process under the so called 'scientific research exception'. Each presents its own challenges (including the likely need to gain ethical approval) and opportunities that will have to be considered according to the particular context in question.

AB  - Background: Community-based primary care focuses on health promotion, awareness raising, and illnesses treatment and prevention in individuals, groups, and communities. Community Health Workers (CHWs) are the leading actors in such programs, helping to bridge the gap between the population and the health system. Many mobile health (mHealth) initiatives have been undertaken to empower CHWs and improve the data collection process in the primary care, replacing archaic paper-based approaches. A special category of mHealth apps, known as mHealth Data Collection Systems (MDCSs), is often used for such tasks. These systems process highly sensitive personal health data of entire communities so that a careful consideration about privacy is paramount for any successful deployment. However, the mHealth literature still lacks methodologically rigorous analyses for privacy and data protection.
   Objective: In this paper, a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) for MDCSs is presented, providing a systematic identification and evaluation of potential privacy risks, particularly emphasizing controls and mitigation strategies to handle negative privacy impacts.
   Methods: The privacy analysis follows a systematic methodology for PIAs. As a case study, we adopt the GeoHealth system, a large-scale MDCS used by CHWs in the Family Health Strategy, the Brazilian program for delivering community-based primary care. All the PIA steps were taken on the basis of discussions among the researchers (privacy and security experts). The identification of threats and controls was decided particularly on the basis of literature reviews and working group meetings among the group. Moreover, we also received feedback from specialists in primary care and software developers of other similar MDCSs in Brazil.
   Results: The GeoHealth PIA is based on 8 Privacy Principles and 26 Privacy Targets derived from the European General Data Protection Regulation. Associated with that, 22 threat groups with a total of 97 subthreats and 41 recommended controls were identified. Among the main findings, we observed that privacy principles can be enhanced on existing MDCSs with controls for managing consent, transparency, intervenability, and data minimization.
   Conclusions: Although there has been significant research that deals with data security issues, attention to privacy in its multiple dimensions is still lacking for MDCSs in general. New systems have the opportunity to incorporate privacy and data protection by design. Existing systems will have to address their privacy issues to comply with new and upcoming data protection regulations. However, further research is still needed to identify feasible and cost-effective solutions.

AB  - The concept of privacy enhancing technologies is central to modem data protection regulation. Systematic protection of privacy has to be built into the design of technology from the outset. The fast development of new technologies and the modification of existing technical solutions makes a continuous privacy impact assessment indispensable. Legal regulation should encourage the development of privacy friendly technical solutions (and standards) and international standardisation should in turn take into account the necessary legal framework rather than trying to replace it. Legal and technical regulation (standardisation) need to be harmonised in order to reinforce each other. Technology must not be allowed to outstrip legal protection. The paper exemplifies this with reference to camera phones, RFID tags and Voice over IP.
   Technology is playing an increasingly important role in ensuring the protection of privacy. Traditionally society and data protection regulators have tended to perceive technological developments as a protential threat to privacy which needed to be contained. More recently the technological potential for safeguarding and indeed improving privacy protection has been recognized/realized (RoGB95). The impacts of technology on privacy may vary depending on the circumstances of deployment. Technology-if not designed properly-can be extremely privacy invasive but it can also-with privacy enhancing features-support the protection of personal privacy. It is all the more important that a certain default level of privacy and additional options for enhanced privacy are built into the technology design from the very start.
   To what extent privacy is or is not sufficiently taken into account when designing new technology may be studied in three examples:
   Camera phones
   RFID
   Voice over IP.

AB  - Background Surgical safety may be improved using a medical data recorder (MDR) for the purpose of postoperative team debriefing. It provides the team in the operating room (OR) with the opportunity to look back upon their joint performance objectively to discuss and learn from suboptimal situations or possible adverse events. The aim of this study was to investigate the satisfaction of the OR team using an MDR, the OR Black Box (R), in the OR as a tool providing output for structured team debriefing. Methods In this longitudinal survey study, 35 gastro-intestinal laparoscopic operations were recorded using the OR Black Box (R) and the output was subsequently debriefed with the operating team. Prior to study, a privacy impact assessment was conducted to ensure alignment with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. A structured debrief model and an OR Back Box (R) performance report was developed. A standardized survey was used to measure participant's satisfaction with the team debriefing, the debrief model used and the performance report. Factor analysis was performed to assess the questionnaire's quality and identified contributing satisfaction factors. Multivariable analysis was performed to identify variables associated with participants' opinions. Results In total, 81 team members of various disciplines in the OR participated, comprising 35 laparoscopic procedures. Mean satisfaction with the OR Black Box (R) performance report and team debriefing was high for all 3 identified independent satisfaction factors. Of all participants, 98% recommend using the OR Black Box (R) and the outcome report in team debriefing. Conclusion The use of an MDR in the OR for the purpose of team debriefing is considered to be both beneficial and important. Team debriefing using the OR Black Box (R) outcome report is highly recommended by 98% of team members participating.

TI  - Embedded RFID and everyday things: A case study of the security and privacy risks of the US e-Passport
T2  - 2006 INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON INDUSTRIAL EMBEDDED SYSTEMS

CP  - International Symposium on Industrial Embedded Systems
AB  - New applications for Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology include embedding transponders in everyday things used by individuals, such as books, payment cards, and personal identification. While RFID technology has existed for decades, these new applications carry with them substantial new privacy and security risks for individuals. These risks arise due to a combination of aspects involved in these applications: 1) The transponders are permanently embedded in objects individuals commonly carry with them 2) Static data linkable to an individual is stored on these transponders 3) The objects these transponders are embedded in are used in public places where individuals have limited control over who can access data on the transponder. In 2002, the U.S. Department of State proposed the adoption of an "electronic passport," which embedded RFID transponders into U.S. passports for identification and document security purposes. In this paper, we use the U.S. Government's adoption process for the electronic passport as a case study for identifying the privacy and security risks that arise by embedding RFID technology in "everyday things." We discuss the reasons why the Department of State did not adequately identify and address these privacy and security risks, even after the government's process mandated a privacy impact assessment. We conclude with recommendations to assist government as well as industry in early identification and resolution of relevant risks posed by RFID technology embedded in everyday things.

TI  - Designing privacy-friendly data repositories: a framework for a blockchain that follows the GDPR
T2  - DIGITAL POLICY REGULATION AND GOVERNANCE
LA  - English
KW  - Privacy
KW  - Blockchain
KW  - GDPR
AB  - Purpose
   The paper posits that a solution for businesses to use privacy-friendly data repositories for its customers' data is to change from the traditional centralized repository to a trusted, decentralized data repository. Blockchain is a technology that provides such a data repository. However, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) assumed a centralized data repository, and it is commonly argued that blockchain technology is not usable. This paper aims to posit a framework for adopting a blockchain that follows the GDPR.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The paper uses the Levy and Ellis' narrative review of literature methodology, which is based on constructivist theory posited by Lincoln and Guba. Using five information systems and computer science databases, the researchers searched for studies using the keywords GDPR and blockchain, using a forward and backward search technique. The search identified a corpus of 416 candidate studies, from which the researchers applied pre-established criteria to select 39 studies. The researchers mined this corpus for concepts, which they clustered into themes. Using the accepted computer science practice of privacy by design, the researchers combined the clustered themes into the paper's posited framework.
   Findings
   The paper posits a framework that provides architectural tactics for designing a blockchain that follows GDPR to enhance privacy. The framework explicitly addresses the challenges of GDPR compliance using the unimagined decentralized storage of personal data. The framework addresses the blockchain-GDPR tension by establishing trust between a business and its customers vis-a-vis storing customers' data. The trust is established through blockchain's capability of providing the customer with private keys and control over their data, e.g. processing and access.
   Research limitations/implications
   The paper provides a framework that demonstrates that blockchain technology can be designed for use in GDPR compliant solutions. In using the framework, a blockchain-based solution provides the ability to audit and monitor privacy measures, demonstrates a legal justification for processing activities, incorporates a data privacy policy, provides a map for data processing and ensures security and privacy awareness among all actors. The research is limited to a focus on blockchain-GDPR compliance; however, future research is needed to investigate the use of the framework in specific domains.
   Practical implications
   The paper posits a framework that identifies the strategies and tactics necessary for GDPR compliance. Practitioners need to compliment the framework with rigorous privacy risk management, i.e. conducting a privacy risk analysis, identifying strategies and tactics to address such risks and preparing a privacy impact assessment that enhances accountability and transparency of a blockchain.
   Originality/value
   With the increasingly strategic use of data by businesses and the contravening growth of data privacy regulation, alternative technologies could provide businesses with a means to nurture trust with its customers regarding collected data. However, it is commonly assumed that the decentralized approach of blockchain technology cannot be applied to this business need. This paper posits a framework that enables a blockchain to be designed that follows the GDPR; thereby, providing an alternative for businesses to collect customers' data while ensuring the customers' trust.

AB  - In order to address the continued decline in consumer trust in all things digital, and specifically the Internet of Things (IoT), we propose a radical overhaul of IoT design processes. Privacy by Design has been proposed as a suitable framework, but we argue the current approach has two failings: it presents too abstract a framework to inform design; and it is often applied after many critical design decisions have been made in defining the business opportunity. To rebuild trust we need the philosophy of Privacy by Design to be transformed into a wider Social Impact Assessment and delivered with practical guidance to be applied at product/service concept stage as well as throughout the system's engineering.

AB  - There is now a flourishing but confusing debate about the ethics of artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies that use data extensively and intensively. There is a rush to define principles and frameworks for these activities, including the research that underlies innovations. This article illustrates and explores some of the perspectives, proposals, inventories and other materials that comprise these efforts. It begins with a look at the current interest in research ethics, and then highlights and comments on examples of the ethical frameworks, principles, and other schemes that have recently appeared. It then considers impact assessment of various kinds, especially regarding data-driven technologies, in which ethical and social issues or values are to the fore. It ends by touching on some issues that relate to attempts to devise ways of dealing with the adverse effects of advanced technologies and systems, including governance and the making of ethics-based judgments.

AB  - The proposal for a new European Data Protection Regulation introduces the novel obligation of performing data protection assessments. Since these assessments will become a mandatory exercise for those in control of data processing systems, they will become an important apparatus for the governance of new and emerging information technologies. This tool, and in particular the notion of "risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects" which is at its core, epitomises the shift from classical legal practice to more risk based approaches. Merging risks and rights in the proposed fashion could change their meanings into something hardly predictable. This contribution proposes to explore the nature of the relation between both concepts within the assessment of a "risk to a right". It will start by mapping out the various relations that exist between risks and rights in different practices. This should serve to identify gaps in the way DPIAs are currently operationalised and might well determine whether the introduction of this methodology in its current form might itself pose a risk to the rights of privacy and data protection. In turn however, it can provide opportunities for improvement and for lessons to be drawn from other practices and expertise that strike different relations between risks and rights, like the ones found in environmental governance and courts.

AB  - The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) caused several new legal requirements software systems in Europe have to comply to. Support for these requirements given by proprietary software systems is limited. Here, an integrative approach of combining software development with GDPR-specific demands is necessary. In this paper, we outline such an approach on the level of software source code. We illustrate how to annotate data in complex software systems and how to use such annotations for task like data visualization, data exchange standardization, and GDPR-specific consent and purpose management systems. Thereby, we outline a research agenda for subsequent efforts in aligning software development and GDPR requirements.

KW  - Data protection impact assessment and cooperative societies
AB  - The GDPR requires all businesses to conduct a risk analysis of the processing of personal data. If this analysis shows that there is a high risk, it will be mandatory to perform a DPIA in order to foresee the impacts and risks this may pose to the privacy of the interested parties. On this basis, the GDPR requires the implementation of security and control measures to guarantee the rights and freedoms of individuals. This paper focuses, on the one hand, on analysing when a cooperative society must carry out a DPIA and, on the other hand, on studying the phases involved in conducting a DPIA correctly.

KW  - Privacy impact assessment
AB  - Privacy risk assessments aim to analyze and quantify the privacy risks associated with new systems. As such, they are critically important in ensuring that adequate privacy protections are built in. However, current methods to quantify privacy risk rely heavily on experienced analysts picking the "correct" risk level on e.g. a five-point scale. In this paper, we argue that a more scientific quantification of privacy risk increases accuracy and reliability and can thus make it easier to build privacy-friendly systems. We discuss how the impact and likelihood of privacy violations can be decomposed and quantified, and stress the importance of meaningful metrics and units of measurement. We suggest a method of quantifying and representing privacy risk that considers a collection of factors as well as a variety of contexts and attacker models. We conclude by identifying some of the major research questions to take this approach further in a variety of application scenarios.

AB  - Cybersecurity Systems (CSSs) play a fundamental role in guaranteeing data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. However, while processing data, CSSs can intentionally or unintentionally expose personal information to people that can misuse them. For this reason, privacy implications of a CSS should be carefully evaluated. This is a challenging task mainly because modern CSSs have complex architectures and components. Moreover, data processed by CSSs can be exposed to different actors, both internal and external to the organization. This contribution presents a methodology, called EPIC, that is specifically designed to evaluate privacy violation risks in cybersecurity systems. Differently, from other general purpose guidelines, EPIC is an operational methodology aimed at guiding security and privacy experts with step-by-step instructions from modeling data exposure in the CSS to the systematical identification of privacy threats and evaluation of their associated privacy violation risk. This contribution also shows the application of the EPIC methodology to the use case of a large academic organization CSS protecting over 15, 000 hosts.

AB  - In this paper, an e-health architecture offering secure remote medical services using WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) enhanced with contextual health information coming from medical connected sensors, is proposed and analyzed. The goal is to allow patients (injured, elderly, disabled, etc.) to benefit from a medical assistance just by calling a remote medical support (doctors, nurses, etc.) using a real-time communication technology such as WebRTC. Moreover, the advancement of the medical devices, on one side, and the emergence of the Web of Things (WoT), on the other side, makes this approach possible. Hence, granting the users the ability of monitoring their own health status and an awareness of their health condition. However, in such architectures, in order for the users to access these services, they need to provide and exchange personal data, and in particular the health related ones. Therefore, user's private information may be exposed to privacy violation and disclosure. Understanding the privacy holes regarding the protection of the personal health related data, identifying the privacy leakage points and studying the privacy requirements are important in order to propose a privacy safeguard for the proposed healthcare architecture, which is the aim of this paper. Additionally, a risk analysis, the sources of these risks and the possible countermeasures are also conducted during this process.

AB  - The new E.U. proposal for a general data protection regulation has been introduced to give an answer to the challenges of the evolving digital environment. In some cases, these expectations could be disappointed, since the proposal is still based on the traditional main pillars of the last generation of data protection laws. In the field of consumer data protection, these pillars are the purpose specification principle, the use limitation principle and the "notice and consent" model. Nevertheless, the complexity of data processing, the power of modern analytics and the "transformative" use of personal information drastically limit the awareness of consumers, their capability to evaluate the various consequences of their choices and to give a free and informed consent.
   To respond to the above, it is necessary to clarify the rationale of the "notice and consent" paradigm, looking back to its origins and assessing its effectiveness in a world of predictive analydcs. From this perspective, the paper considers the historical evolution of data protection and how the fundamental issues coming from the technological and socioeconomic contexts have been addressed by regulations. On the basis of this analysis, the author suggests a revision of the "notice and consent" model focused on the opt-in and proposes the adoption of a different approach when, such as in Big Data collection, the data subject cannot be totally aware of the tools of analysis and their potential output. For this reason, the author sustains the provision of a subset of rules for Big Data analytics, which is based on a multiple impact assessment of data processing, on a deeper level of control by data protection authorities, and on the different opt-out model.

AB  - The present work deals with the interrelationships of blockchain technology and the new European General Data Protection Regulation, that will be intact after May 28th, 2018. The regulation harmonizes personal data protection across the European Union and aims to return the ownership of personal data to the individual. This thesis, therefore, addresses the question how this new technology that is characterized by decentralization, immutability and truly digitized values will be affected by the strict privacy regulation and vice versa. The aim of this work is to clarify whether blockchains can comply with the new regulation on the one hand and to identify how blockchain could support its compliance, on the other hand. The questions are validated through an extensive literature review and are further investigated by using a Delphi study that asks a panel of 25 renowned experts to find opportunities, limitations and general suggestions about both topics. In addition, a framework is proposed to support the assessment of privacy and related risks of blockchains.

AB  - Ubiquitous computing is characterized by the merger of physical and virtual worlds as physical artifacts gain digital sensing, processing, and communication capabilities. Maintaining an appropriate level of privacy in the face of such complex and often highly dynamic systems is challenging. We argue that context awareness not only enables novel UbiComp applications but can also support dynamic regulation and configuration of privacy mechanisms. We propose a higher level context model that abstracts from low level details and contains only privacy relevant context features. Context changes in our model can trigger reconfiguration of privacy mechanisms or facilitate context-specific privacy recommendations to the user. Based on our model, we analyze potential privacy implications of context changes and discuss how these results could inform actual reconfiguration of privacy mechanisms.

AB  - Modern applications in the Smart Building and Industry 4.0 scenarios will be complex software ecosystems with strict requirements of geographic distribution, heterogeneity, dynamic evolution, security and privacy protection, highly more challenging than the ones required by the current environments.
   Two of the main challenges arising in the current Internet Of Things scenarios, i.e., the Smart Building one, are, on one side, the requirement of interconnecting several heterogeneous platforms and smart Things in the same environment and, on the other side, the need to be able to evolve the complex software ecosystem deployed, reacting automatically and at runtime to environmental changes, without the human intervention.
   To address these challenges, BRAIN-IoT establishes a framework and methodology supporting smart cooperative behaviour in fully de-centralized, composable and dynamic federations of heterogeneous Internet of Things platforms. In this way, BRAIN-IoT enables smart autonomous behaviour in Internet of Things scenarios, involving heterogeneous sensors and actuators autonomously cooperating to execute complex, dynamic tasks. Furthermore, BRAIN-IoT enables dynamically deploying and orchestrating distributed applications, allowing the automatic installation and replacement of smnart behaviours reacting to environmental changes and User events. Finally, BRAIN-IoT provides a set of components that guarantee the security and privacy protection of the data exchanged using the solution.
   BRAIN-IoT is a general purpose solution that aims at being adaptable for heterogeneous scenarios, from Service Robotics to Critical Infrastructure Management. This paper introduces a Smart Building use case of the solution, which allows highlighting the advantages given by BRAIN-IoT in such scenario.

We validate this process and framework by conducting a GDPR implementation with a charity that works with vulnerable adults. This charity processes both special category (sensitive) and personally identifiable data. This GDPR implementation was conducted and devised for the charity sector, but can be equally applied in any organisation that need to implement GDPR or conduct DPIAs.

AB  - Article 35 of the GDPR introduces the legal obligation to perform DPIAs in cases where the processing operations are likely to present high risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. This obligation is part of a change of approach in the GDPR towards a modified compliance scheme in terms of a reinforced principle of accountability. The DPIA is a prominent example of this approach given that it has an inclusive, comprehensive and proactive nature. Its importance lies in the fact that it forces data controllers to identify, assess and ultimately manage the high risks to the rights and freedoms. However, what is first and foremost important for a meaningful performance of DPIAs, is to have a common and objective understanding of what constitutes a risk in the field of data protection and of how to assess its likelihood and severity. The legislature has approached these concepts via the method of denotation, meaning by giving examples of (highly) risky processing operations. This article suggests a complementary approach, the connotation of these concepts and explains the added value of such a method. By way of a case-study the article also demonstrates the importance of performing complete and accurate DPIAs, in terms of contributing to improving the protection of personal data.

AB  - As the upsurge of information and communication technologies has become the foundation of all modern application domains, fueled by the unprecedented amount of data being processed and exchanged, besides security concerns, there are also pressing privacy considerations that come into play. Compounding this issue, there is currently a documented gap between the cybersecurity and privacy risk assessment (RA) avenues, which are treated as distinct management processes and capitalise on rather rigid and make-like approaches. In this paper, we aim to combine the best of both worlds by proposing the APSIA (Automated Privacy and Security Impact Assessment) methodology, which stands for Automated Privacy and Security Impact Assessment. APSIA is powered by the use of interdependency graph models and data processing flows used to create a digital reflection of the cyber-physical environment of an organisation. Along with this model, we present a novel and extensible privacy risk scoring system for quantifying the privacy impact triggered by the identified vulnerabilities of the ICT infrastructure of an organisation. We provide a prototype implementation and demonstrate its applicability and efficacy through a specific case study in the context of a heavily regulated sector (i.e., assistive healthcare domain) where strict security and privacy considerations are not only expected but mandated so as to better showcase the beneficial characteristics of APSIA. Our approach can complement any existing security-based RA tool and provide the means to conduct an enhanced, dynamic and generic assessment as an integral part of an iterative and unified risk assessment process on-the-fly. Based on our findings, we posit open issues and challenges, and discuss possible ways to address them, so that such holistic security and privacy mechanisms can reach their full potential towards solving this conundrum.

AB  - Data protection authorities worldwide have agreed on the value of considering privacy-by-design principles when developing privacy-friendly systems and software. However, on the technical plane, a profusion of privacy-oriented guidelines and approaches coexists, which provides partial solutions to the overall problem and aids engineers during different stages of the system development lifecycle. As a result, engineers find difficult to understand what they should do to make their systems abide by privacy by design, thus hindering the adoption of privacy engineering practices. This paper reviews existing best practices in the analysis and design stages of the system development lifecycle, introduces a systematic methodology for privacy engineering that merges and integrates them, leveraging their best features whilst addressing their weak points, and describes its alignment with current standardization efforts.

AB  - Risk management is a well-known method to face technological challenges through a win-win combination of protective and proactive approaches, fostering the collaboration of operators, researchers, regulators, and industries for the exploitation of new markets. In the field of autonomous and unmanned aerial systems, or UAS, a considerable amount of work has been devoted to risk analysis, the generation of ground risk maps, and ground risk assessment by estimating the fatality rate. The paper aims to expand this approach with a tool for managing data protection risks raised by drones through the design of flight maps. The tool should allow UAS operators choosing the best air corridor for their drones based on the so-called privacy by design principle pursuant to Article 25 of the EU data protection regulation, the GDPR. Among the manifold applications of this approach, the design of fly zones for drones can be tailored for public authorities in the phase of authorization of new operations, much as for national Data Protection authorities that have to control the lawfulness of personal data processing by UAS operations. The overall aim is to present the first win-win approach to data protection issues, aerospace engineering challenges, and risk management methods for the threats posed by this technology.

AB  - Privacy and security are crosscutting in the design of any software system or service, and thus a broad focus on the end-to-end system architecture is required. For this reason, systematic approaches to elicitate security and privacy threats and risks are gaining importance. Such approaches however are highly analytic, require substantial effort and rely extensively on domain expertise. Applying these methods in practice easily leads to the problem of threat explosion, where the effort required to prioritize and consider all threats starts exceeding the benefits of adopting these methods.
   To address this impediment to practical adoption, we present our approach to improve LINDDUN, an existing privacy engineering method. We create a domain refinement questionnaire, which involves activating and deactivating threat trees nodes by posing specific questions to the privacy engineer or software architect, leading to the a priori exclusion of non-applicable threats from the analysis exercise. The efficiency gain can be strengthened further by incorporating reusable domain knowledge in the approach to instantiate the questionnaire.

AB  - This paper explores the European Commission's proposal for a new Regulation to update and reform data protection law in Europe. As regards the Regulation itself, without presenting an exhaustive analysis of all the provisions, this paper aims to highlight some significant changes proposed to the data protection regime by comparison between Directive 95/46 and the proposed Regulation. It takes particularly into account legislative innovation concerning data protection principles, data subjects' rights, data controllers and data processors obligations, and the regulation of technologies. Before analyzing these innovations, it introduces some considerations about the Commission's choice to use a Regulation instead of a Directive to harmonize national data protection regime.

AB  - Scoliosis is the most common spinal deformity in children. The deformity occurs in varying severity in all three planes: back-front; side-to-side; top-to-bottom. About 80% of cases are idiopathic, that is a specific cause is not known. Treatment decisions and timing are optimized with an electronic health record (EHR) providing the entire patient's history and calculated risk factors while the patient is still at the clinic. The EHR consists of a tablet or a Bluetooth (R) or Wi-Fi enabled laptop or PC and handheld personal data assistant (PDA). Each patient has a profile in the EHR, which has all of her clinical history. The surgeon can view the entire clinical history of the patient while in the examination room and at the same time enter in any new measurements and comments for the current examination. After seeing the patient the surgeon prints a record for the chart. This EHR improves both efficiency and accuracy, and can save significant time, as there is less duplication of work and no dictation is required. Data can be combined from remote sites and 'mined' to extract specific parameters to address clinical or research questions.

AB  - The purpose of the paper is to provide a comprehensive privacy model for identifying the privacy risks of an enterprise based on its privacy requirements. A risk-based methodology for automated privacy control selection against identified privacy requirements is also proposed. The privacy model has been designed using first order logic and it is semi-formal in nature. Privacy risks are defined using the proposed formalism in terms of privacy properties. Algorithm for assessing privacy risk considering the actual information infrastructure of the enterprise is proposed. Based on the risk assessment, appropriate privacy controls should be selected from a control database. An algorithm for the same is also proposed. This methodology is easy to implement and can be used by any mid or large-scale enterprise for privacy control implementation. The effectiveness of our proposed approach is shown using a case study. From the literature review, it has emerged that there is a dearth of comprehensive privacy models that can identify the privacy requirements emanating from different sources and can eventually help the enterprise to implement privacy controls as per privacy requirements. The proposed model attempts to address this research gap by helping an enterprise to identify the specific privacy requirements and automatically select privacy controls from an appropriate knowledge base. Privacy requirements can be customized as per the needs of the enterprise.

AB  - The use of privacy protection measures is of particular importance for existing and upcoming users' digital identities. Thus, the recently adopted EU Regulation on Electronic identification and trust services (eIDAS) explicitly allows the use of pseudonyms in the context of eID systems, without specifying how they should be implemented. The paper contributes to the discussion on pseudonyms and multiple identities, by (1) providing an original analysis grid that can be applied for privacy evaluation in any eID architecture, and (2) introducing the concept of eID deployer allowing virtually any case of the relationship between the user, the eID implementation and the user's digital identities to be modelled. Based on these inputs, a comparative analysis of four exemplary eID architectures deployed in European countries is conducted. The paper also discusses how sensitive citizens of these countries are to the privacy argument while adopting these systems, and presents the "privacy adoption paradox".

TI  - Living in areas with different levels of earthquake damage and association with risk of cardiovascular disease: a cohort-linkage study
T2  - LANCET PLANETARY HEALTH
LA  - English
AB  - Background Cardiovascular disease rates are known to increase immediately after a severe earthquake. However, less is known about the magnitude of this increase over time in relation to the amount of housing damage. We assessed the effect of area housing damage from a major earthquake sequence in Christchurch, Canterbury province, New Zealand, on cardiovascular disease-related hospital admissions and deaths.
   Methods For this cohort-linkage study, we used linked administrative datasets from the Statistics New Zealand Integrated Data Infrastructure to identify individuals aged 45 years or older living in Christchurch from the date of the first earthquake on Sept 4, 2010. Individuals were assigned the average damage level for their residential meshblock (small neighbourhood generally comprising 10-50 dwellings) using the insurance-assessed residential building damage costs obtained from the Earthquake Commission as a proportion of property value. We calculated the rates of cardiovascular disease-related hospital admissions (including myocardial infarction) and cardiovascular disease-related mortality and rate ratios (adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, small-area deprivation index, and personal income) by level of housing damage in the first year and the 4 subsequent years after the earthquake. The rate ratio association between earthquake housing damage and cardiovascular event was examined by Poisson regression, and linear test of trends across damage categories was done by regression modeling.
   Findings We identified 179 000 residents living in the earthquake-affected region of Christchurch, of whom 148 000 had complete data. For the first 3 months after the Feb 22, 2011 earthquake, the Poisson regression-adjusted rate ratio (RR) for cardiovascular disease-related hospital admissions for residents from areas that were most damaged (compared with residents from the least damaged areas) was 1.12 (95% CI 0.96-1.32; test for linear trend p=0.239). In the first year after the earthquake sequence, for residents from areas that were most damaged (vs the least damaged areas), Poisson regression-adjusted RRs were 1.10 (1.01-1.21; test for linear trend p=0.068) for cardiovascular disease-related hospital admissions, 1.22 (1.00-1.48; p=0.036) for myocardial infarction-related hospital admissions, and 1.25 (1.06-1.47; p=0.105) for cardiovascular disease-related mortality, corresponding to an excess of 66 (95% CI 7-125) cardiovascular disease-related hospital admissions, including 29 (0-53) additional myocardial infarction-related hospital admissions and 46 (13-73) additional deaths from cardiovascular disease. In the 4 subsequent years, we found no evidence of an association of these outcomes with earthquake damage.
   Interpretation Rates of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction were increased in people living in areas with more severely damaged homes in the first year after a major earthquake. Policy responses to reduce the effect of earthquake damage on cardiovascular disease could include pre-earthquake measures to minimise building damage, early wellbeing interventions within the first year to address post-earthquake stress, and enhanced provision of cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment services.

AB  - Open data debate and PSI (public sector information) legislation have so far focused on the access to public rather than personal data for reuse purposes. As a number of cases discussed before some European Data Protection Authorities have shown over the past years, however, conditions of access to PSI for reuse purposes may raise issues of data protection. Consider commercial and land registers, case law databases, public deliberations, vehicle registrations, socioeconomic data, and more, in light of such techniques as big data analytics. Correspondingly, it is likely that the reuse of PSI will increasingly concern principles and criteria for making personal data processing legitimate. The aim of this paper is to examine today's legal framework and the technical means that may enable the lawful reuse of personal data, collected and held by public sector bodies. Whereas openness and data protection are often conceived as opposed in a 'zero sum game,' the paper explores whether a 'win-win' scenario is feasible.

AB  - Conversational agents (CAs) such as Google Home or Alexa offer empowering opportunities for dyads composed of older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and their care partners. CAs support coordination and planning between the two, and can amplify the support that the care partner needs to provide. In this study, we observed how ten such dyads interacted with a Google Home over 10 weeks. We logged and analyzed 3,878 total interactions, interviewed the dyads to better understand their experiences, and also surveyed their individual preferences and priorities for automated assistance in the home. We found that CAs empowered both the people who had MCI, and their care partners. We observed that the utility of the CA in the day-to-day lives of users largely depended on how much the care partner scaffolded promising functionality, setting it up and contextualizing it for specific needs and desires.

AB  - Virtual personal assistants (VPAs) are increasingly becoming a common aspect of everyday living. However, with female names, voices and characters, these devices appear to reproduce harmful gender stereotypes about the role of women in society and the type of work women perform. Designed to 'assist', VPAs - such as Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa - reproduce and reify the idea that women are subordinate to men, and exist to be 'used' by men. Despite their ubiquity, these aspects of their design have seen little critical attention in scholarship, and the potential legal responses to this issue have yet to be fully canvassed. Accordingly, this article sets out to critique the reproduction of negative gender stereotypes in VPAs and explores the provisions and findings within international women's rights law to assess both how this constitutes indirect discrimination and possible means for redress. In this regard, this article explores the obligation to protect women from discrimination at the hands of private actors under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, and the work of the Committee on Discrimination Against Women on gender stereotyping. With regard to corporate human rights responsibilities, the role of the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights is examined, as well as domestic enforcement mechanisms for international human rights norms and standards, noting the limitations to date in enforcing human rights compliance by multinational private actors.

AB  - Privacy by Design (PbD) is a kind of precautionary legal technology design. It takes opportunities for fundamental rights without creating risks for them. Now the EU Commission "promised" to implement PbD with Art. 23(4) of its proposal of a General Data Protection Regulation. It suggests setting up a committee that can define technical standards for PbD. However the Commission did not keep its promise. Should it be left to the IT security experts who sit in the committee but do not have the legal expertise, to decide on our privacy or, by using overly detailed specifications, to prevent businesses from marketing innovative products? This paper asserts that the Commission's implementation of PbD is not acceptable as it stands and makes positive contributions for the work of a future PbD committee so that the Commission can keep its promise to introduce precautionary legal technology design.

AB  - This paper posits that ethical dilemma scenarios are a useful instrument to provoke policy-makers and other stakeholders, to including industry, in considering the privacy, ethical, social and other implications of new and emerging technologies. It describes a methodology for constructing and deconstructing such scenarios and provides four such scenarios in an orthogonal relationship with each other. The paper describes some different, but closely related scenario construction-deconstruction methodologies, which formed the basis for the methodology adopted in the European Commission-funded PRESCIENT project. The paper makes the point that in ethical dilemma scenarios, it is not immediately apparent what choices policy-makers should select. Hence, there is a need for undertaking a privacy and ethical impact assessment and engaging stakeholders in the process to identify and discuss the issues raised in the scenarios.

AB  - A law in Japan has been established concerning the My Number system or the use of numbers for identifying specific individuals in administrative procedures in local governments. The law requires local governments to implement the specific personal implementation protection assessment for social security and tax number systems. In this paper, we analyzed the assessment reports of the specific personal information protection assessments conducted by local governments. We did the analysis in two directions: (1) adequacy of risk assessment and measures, and (2) reuse of the assessment report. Our analysis shows that there was a description of assessment on the risk assessment items, but there were many assessment reports with missing assessment on some operations.

AB  - This case study presents a qualitative assessment of the reliability of digital forensic investigation in criminal cases in Norway. A reliability validation methodology based on international digital forensic standards was designed to assess to what extent those standards are implemented and followed by law enforcement in their casework. 124 reports related to the acquisition, examination, and analysis of three types of digital data sources -computers, mobile phones, and storage devices were examined. The reports were extracted from the criminal case management system used by the police and prosecution services. The reports were examined on technology, method, and application level in order to assess the reliability of digital evidence for criminal proceedings. The study found that digital forensic investigation in 21 randomly sampled criminal cases in Norway were insufficiently documented to assess the reliability of the digital evidence. It was not possible to trace the digital forensic actions performed on each item or link the digital evidence to its source. None of the cases were shown to comply with digital forensic methodology, justify the methods and tools used, or validate tool results and error rates.(c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Data privacy regulatory framework is evolving. The long awaited EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) sets new standards by increasing and improving online personal data protection (i.e. privacy). In order for informatics to take and safeguard a firm compliance stand, privacy concerns should be addressed both by design and by default. In the same time special attention is needed as to avoid smothering the added value provided by the (vast) quantity and (low) cost of web-residing-information. By combining regulation, information privacy and best practices into UML use case diagrams, paper in hand examines GDPR requirements by utilizing the educational e-platform paradigm "Law Courses"(1). Ultimately it aims to equip engineers with a GDPR-standards compatible software incorporation case.

AB  - AIM: To describe the use of opioid analgesics over three years before and after total joint replacement surgery in New Zealand.
   METHOD: We extracted information on all individuals undergoing publicly funded total hip or knee replacement surgery in New Zealand between June 2011 and December 2014, and linked data on opioid prescribing, from the Statistics New Zealand Integrated Data Infrastructure. We analysed monthly opioid use over the three years before and after surgery and the transition from pre-operative and/or immediate post-operative use to chronic post-operative use.
   RESULTS: The prevalence of opioid use increased from 7% three years before surgery to 22% immediately prior to surgery, was common (75%) in the month following surgery and declined rapidly to 10-12% per month over the following years. Patients dispensed opioids prior to surgery or in the post-operative recovery period were at significantly higher risk of subsequent chronic opioid use.
   CONCLUSION: Opioid analgesic prescribing was reduced following joint replacement surgery, although a substantial minority of patients remained long-term opioid users. Avoiding unnecessary pre-operative opioid use and limiting opioid use for post-operative pain management where appropriate could help to reduce the risk of potentially ineffective or harmful long-term opioid use in these patients.

TI  - An estimate of limited duration cancer prevalence in New Zealand using 'big' data
T2  - NEW ZEALAND MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - AIMS: Increases in cancer survival may increase cancer prevalence and demand for healthcare. We aimed to estimate cancer prevalence in the New Zealand population.
   METHODS: We used national linked health, social and census datasets from the Stats NZ Integrated Data Infrastructure to identify the number of New Zealand residents who had at least one cancer diagnosis in New Zealand. We included all primary cancers recorded on the New Zealand Cancer Registry from January 1995 to June 2013, and used the 2013 census for demographic and socioeconomic data.
   RESULTS: On 30 June 2013, 140,600 of 4,438,900 (3.2%) New Zealand residents had been diagnosed with cancer in the last 18.5 years. In >= 15 year olds, the age-standardised prevalence of cancer diagnosed 0 to <= 1 year, and >1 to <= 5 years, prior to 30 June 2013 was 0.4% and 1.1% in men and 0.3% and 0.9% in women, respectively. Over the 18.5-year period prevalence was greatest in the oldest ages, European/Other, highest qualified, highest income, least deprived, ex-smokers, and Canterbury, Bay of Plenty and Nelson/Marlborough District Health Boards (age-standardised).
   CONCLUSIONS: Groups with the highest survival and the greatest access to healthcare had the highest cancer prevalences.

AB  - Privacy has become an increasingly significant apprehension in today's rapidly changing economy primarily for personal and sensitive user data. The levels of personal data violation are increasing day by day however privacy-preserving frameworks are available. This paper conducted an in-depth analysis of contemporary frameworks to identify the key mechanisms to produce a sophisticated data privacy framework to reduce the rate of data breach particularly for the Patient Record Management System (PRMS). There are several studies available that stated healthcare data privacy, still, complete data protection solution with the application of privacy by design towards patients' health data by ensuring privacy in each layer of the PRMS are quite limited, which is the focus of this study. PRMS manages personal and sensitive data while delivering healthcare services to the patients and as such, have also the potential to carry significant risks to the privacy of their data. A novel conceptual framework with three distinct and sequential phases is suggested in this research, each of which is defined in a distinct section. The first phase is defined as the planning to identify the key limitations of contemporary frameworks so these can be minimized to ensure privacy in each layer of data processing. The second phase incorporates the key components of data privacy to satisfy the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed framework. Finally, the third phase is the implementation of the selected requirements of the assessment phase to prevent privacy incursion events in PRMS. The complete framework is anticipated to deliver a sophisticated resistance in contradiction to the continuous data breaches in the patients' information domain.

AB  - Forensic Science is gaining more importance in criminal justice, since the development of new sensitive and accurate scientific tools, and the construction of large computerized databases. Although very effective, these databases pose a lot of legislative and ethical concerns. In case of DNA concerns are deeper since it contains sensitive genetic information regarding its owner, not necessarily needed for his identification. This paper focuses on issues related to the collection, utilization and retention of DNA samples and profiles of legally innocent populations, illustrated by a case study where a voluntarily given DNA sample for a murder investigation successfully solved three non related rape cases.

AB  - Using administrative data on 4 million citizens from two nations, Richmond-Rakerd et al. find that multiple health and social problems cluster in a population segment with low workforce readiness, including low education and poor early-life mental health.
   Health and social scientists have documented the hospital revolving-door problem, the concentration of crime, and long-term welfare dependence. Have these distinct fields identified the same citizens? Using administrative databases linked to 1.7 million New Zealanders, we quantified and monetized inequality in distributions of health and social problems and tested whether they aggregate within individuals. Marked inequality was observed: Gini coefficients equalled 0.96 for criminal convictions, 0.91 for public-hospital nights, 0.86 for welfare benefits, 0.74 for prescription-drug fills and 0.54 for injury-insurance claims. Marked aggregation was uncovered: a small population segment accounted for a disproportionate share of use-events and costs across multiple sectors. These findings were replicated in 2.3 million Danes. We then integrated the New Zealand databases with the four-decade-long Dunedin Study. The high-need/high-cost population segment experienced early-life factors that reduce workforce readiness, including low education and poor mental health. In midlife they reported low life satisfaction. Investing in young people's education and training potential could reduce health and social inequalities and enhance population wellbeing.

AB  - To the best of our knowledge, this paper reports the first set of nationally representative results on the importance of 'absorptive capacity' (generally defined as a firm's ability to internalise external knowledge) for firms. Using data principally from the Business Operations Survey 2005-15, we measure absorptive capacity in New Zealand (NZ) firms across a 10-year period and investigate if it remains stable in the long term. This is followed by considering how firms' characteristics vary across levels of absorptive capacity and most importantly whether such capacity determines firms' productivity performance across the primary, manufacturing and service sectors. Our results show that relative to other influences, absorptive capacity as measured here-net of the impact of, for example, foreign-ownership and human capital-has a substantial influence on exporting, innovation and undertaking R&D, and thus consequently firm-level productivity. Set against relatively poor productivity performance, the paper concludes with a discussion of how government should consider helping firms to boost their levels of absorptive capacity in NZ.
